    overview:
      "AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous software systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals. This category covers frameworks, platforms, and tools for building, deploying, and orchestrating AI agents in production environments.",
    whyMatters:
      "AI agents represent a shift from passive AI tools to active, goal-driven systems. They are being deployed across customer support, software development, data analysis, and business process automation. The ecosystem is evolving rapidly with new agent frameworks, multi-agent orchestration patterns, and evaluation benchmarks emerging weekly.",
    openSourceVsCommercial:
      "The AI agent space shows a strong open-source presence. Community-driven frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen dominate developer mindshare, while commercial platforms focus on enterprise deployment, observability, and managed infrastructure. The boundary between open-source frameworks and commercial managed services is a key signal to watch.",
    projectSlugs: ["aurora-code", "nucleus-ml"],
    fastestDevMomentum:
      "Projects in this category show the strongest dev momentum among indexed categories, with consistent GitHub activity, frequent releases, and active community contributions. Open-source agent frameworks tend to have faster iteration cycles than managed services.",

      },
      {
        q: "How is dev momentum measured for AI agent projects?",
        a: "Dev Momentum is assessed from public signals including GitHub commit frequency, release cadence, contributor diversity, and community engagement. It does not use private or unverifiable data.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are all AI agent projects open source?",
        a: "No. The category includes both open-source frameworks and commercial platforms. The open-source vs commercial dimension is tracked as part of Signal Score analysis.",
      },

    methodologyNote:
      "Category projects are indexed from public sources. Signal Scores use only publicly verifiable data. Commercial readiness and product readiness scores are based on observable public signals, not private financial or usage data.",

    whyMatters:
      "AI coding is one of the fastest-growing AI application categories. These tools are changing how software is built, reviewed, and maintained. Developer adoption metrics, IDE integration depth, and model quality are key differentiators in this category.",
    openSourceVsCommercial:
      "The AI coding category has a mix of open-source tools (code reviewers, linters, search) and commercial offerings (AI-powered IDEs, hosted code assistants). Open-source projects tend to focus on specific workflows (code review, test generation), while commercial platforms offer integrated suites with proprietary models.",
    projectSlugs: ["aurora-code"],

        q: "Does 88CN track proprietary AI coding tools?",
        a: "88CN indexes projects based on publicly available information. Proprietary tools with public product pages and documentation can be included, but Signal Scores for proprietary projects may have lower source confidence due to limited public development signals.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does 88CN evaluate code generation quality?",
        a: "88CN does not evaluate code generation quality directly. Signal Scores reflect product readiness, dev momentum, and market presence from public signals. Quality assessment is left to editorial review and community feedback.",
      },

    overview:
      "Open Source AI encompasses projects released under permissive open-source licenses that provide AI models, training frameworks, inference engines, fine-tuning tools, and model evaluation suites. This category tracks the open-source AI ecosystem beyond individual model releases.",
    whyMatters:
      "Open source AI is the foundation of the broader AI ecosystem. Open models, training frameworks, and inference tools enable wider experimentation, lower barriers to entry, and community-driven improvement. Tracking open-source AI projects reveals infrastructure trends before they appear in commercial products.",
    openSourceVsCommercial:
      "This category focuses specifically on open-source projects. The distinction from commercial offerings is central to the category. Projects are assessed on license clarity, community governance, contribution diversity, and downstream adoption rather than commercial metrics.",
    projectSlugs: ["vectorbase", "aurora-code"],

        q: "What licenses qualify as open source for this category?",
        a: "88CN considers MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, and GPL-family licenses as open source. Projects with custom or restrictive source-available licenses may be included but noted as having license constraints.",

        q: "Does 88CN track open-source model releases?",

    title: "Local LLM",
    overview:
      "Local LLM projects enable running large language models on personal or edge devices without cloud dependencies. This category covers model quantization tools, local inference engines, on-device model serving, and applications built on local-first AI infrastructure.",
    whyMatters:
      "Local LLM represents a shift toward privacy-preserving, low-latency AI that runs without cloud API dependencies. This category matters for privacy-sensitive applications, offline-capable tools, and edge deployment scenarios where cloud connectivity is unreliable or undesirable.",
    openSourceVsCommercial:
      "The local LLM space is predominantly open source. Quantization tools (llama.cpp, Ollama), local inference servers, and on-device runtime frameworks are community-driven. Commercial interest is growing in managed local deployment and enterprise on-premise AI infrastructure.",
    projectSlugs: ["scribe-ai"],
    fastestDevMomentum:
      "Local LLM projects show rapid iteration cycles driven by model quantization improvements and inference optimization. The pace of development is tied to upstream model releases and quantization technique advances rather than traditional software release cycles.",

      },
      {
        q: "How does 88CN evaluate local LLM project quality?",
        a: "88CN assesses Product Readiness (documentation, ease of setup), Dev Momentum (repository activity, release frequency), and Trust Confidence (license clarity, community health). Actual model quality is not evaluated by the index.",

    whyMatters:
      "RAG is the dominant pattern for grounding AI outputs in factual data. It powers enterprise knowledge bases, customer support bots, research assistants, and code-aware AI tools. The RAG ecosystem spans infrastructure (vector databases), middleware (retrieval frameworks), and applications.",
    openSourceVsCommercial:
      "The RAG tools category has strong open-source foundations in vector databases and retrieval frameworks. Commercial offerings focus on managed vector databases, hosted RAG pipelines, and enterprise knowledge management platforms. Open-source projects lead in innovation, while commercial platforms lead in managed reliability.",
