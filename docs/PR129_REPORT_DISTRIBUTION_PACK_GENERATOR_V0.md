## Scope Boundary

This PR implements local draft artifact generation only. It does not modify app routes, components, report pages, sitemap runtime, API routes, MCP routes, deploy config, public assets, package-lock, Supabase, external services, or `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`.

## PR130 Handoff

PR130 should QA the generator by running dry-run and `/tmp` output modes, inspecting `manifest.json`, checking safety flags, verifying draft files are local only, and confirming no repo-generated artifacts are committed.
