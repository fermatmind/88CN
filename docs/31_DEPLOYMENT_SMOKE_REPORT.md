## Browser QA

Screenshots were captured from live `88cn.com` pages:

## Known Limitations

1. Direct SSH from the local workstation still times out during banner exchange, so Cloud Assistant remains the reliable execution path.
2. Supabase env is NOT CONFIGURED; submit and claim write-path smoke correctly returned graceful 503 responses.
3. Low-intensity throttling reached 429 quickly; no high-volume load test was performed.
4. Nginx generated 429 responses are HTML, not application Problem Details, but they now include the required operational and security headers.

## Secrets
