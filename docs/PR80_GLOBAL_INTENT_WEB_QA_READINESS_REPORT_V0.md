# PR80 Global Intent Web QA + Readiness Report v0

## Result

PASS.

PR80 reviewed the PR61-PR79 Global Intent Interception Web phase as QA-only readiness evidence. The phase remains bounded by reviewed registries, published-only project filtering, explicit sitemap eligibility, no arbitrary pSEO generation, no external indexing calls, no deploy, no Public API or MCP release, no payment behavior, and no `88cn-index-data` mutation.

PR80 does not implement product code, create routes, change app runtime, deploy, ping IndexNow, call Google Indexing API, contact external search engines, mutate the data repo, or start PR81.

## Repo State

## Route Inventory

| Surface | Route Files | Generated / Public Routes | Boundary Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reports | `app/reports/page.tsx`, `app/reports/[slug]/page.tsx`, two fixed report pages | 5 sitemap report URLs: `/reports`, two fixed report pages, and two demo report slugs. | PASS |
| Tech stacks | `app/stacks/[slug]/page.tsx` | 3 published stack routes: `ai-coding-workflows`, `model-training-infrastructure`, `vector-search-infrastructure`. | PASS |
| Collections | `app/collections/[slug]/page.tsx` | 3 published collection routes: `open-source-ai-agents`, `commercial-readiness-signals`, `model-and-search-infrastructure`. | PASS |
| Verticals | `app/verticals/[slug]/page.tsx` | 3 published vertical routes: `ai-builder-infrastructure`, `model-and-search-infrastructure`, `analytics-and-operations-tools`. | PASS |
| Alternatives | `app/alternatives/[slug]/page.tsx` | 3 canonical alternatives routes: `aurora-code-vs-nucleus-ml`, `nucleus-ml-vs-vectorbase`, `complykit-vs-pulse-analytics`. | PASS |

Route behavior inspected:

- All stack, collection, vertical, and alternatives pages use `generateStaticParams()` from registry helpers.
- Unknown or ineligible slugs return `notFound()` or noindex metadata.
- Public dynamic routes require `status === "published"` and `sitemapEligible`.
- Collection and vertical routes also enforce `minimumPublishedProjects`.
- Project inclusion helpers filter to local published projects.
- Alternatives enforce canonical pair order and exactly two published projects.

## Sitemap Inventory

Built sitemap evidence from `.next/server/app/sitemap.xml.body` after local build:

| Group | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Root | 1 |
| Projects | 7 |
| Founders | 1 |
| Genesis | 1 |
| GEO checker | 1 |
| Categories | 5 |
| Collections | 3 |
| Stacks | 3 |
| Verticals | 3 |
| Alternatives | 3 |
| Reports | 5 |
| Total | 33 |

Sitemap review result:

- No `/admin`, `/api`, `/mcp`, or payment routes appear in the built sitemap.
- No submitted, pending, quarantined, scouted, rejected, draft, noindex, or archived registry entries appear in the built sitemap.
- Sitemap entries are sourced from published project states, finite categories, published collections, published stacks, published verticals, canonical published alternatives, and published reports.
- Sitemap count is bounded at 33 URLs in the current build.
- No arbitrary generated alternatives, collections, verticals, or stack routes appear.

## Scaled Content Abuse Review

| Risk | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arbitrary programmatic route generation | PASS | Dynamic routes derive static params from finite registry helpers only. |
| Freeform query-param generated pages | PASS | Inspected route files do not generate public pages from query params. |
| N-squared alternatives pages | PASS | Alternatives registry has route cap 3 and three canonical entries only. |
| Reversed duplicate alternatives route | PASS | Reverse slugs are absent from alternatives registry and generated route set. |
| AI-generated filler text | PASS | PR61/PR62 policies forbid filler; inspected public registries contain finite editorial summaries and boundary notes. |
| Template-only low-value page explosion | PASS | Registry counts are 3 stacks, 3 collections, 3 verticals, and 3 alternatives. |
| Sitemap explosion | PASS | Built sitemap contains 33 URLs. |
| Route registry bypass | PASS | Published route helpers use finite local registries and published-only helpers. |
| Indexable page requirements | PASS | Indexable dynamic pages are allowlisted, published, sitemap-eligible, and thresholded where applicable. |

## Public Copy / Forbidden Claim Review

| Area | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public language policy | PASS | `npm run policy:scan` passed. |
| Brand voice guard | PASS | `npm run brand-voice:check` passed with restricted-claim probes. |
| Ranking, traffic, citation, backlink promises | PASS | Broad search found these terms only in prohibition or boundary contexts, not as public outcome promises. |
| Vertical advice / regulated claims | PASS | PR69 and vertical boundary notes forbid legal, financial, medical, investment, compliance, safety, certification, and outcome guarantees. |
| Alternatives superiority claims | PASS | Alternatives policy and checker guard neutral canonical comparisons and no superiority promises. |
| GitHub mirror promises | PASS | Generated markdown explicitly says it does not promise ranking, traffic, citation, funding, revenue, or adoption outcomes. |

## Data Leakage Review

| Surface | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project inclusion | PASS | Helpers filter projects to published/claimed/owner-verified sitemap states or published records depending surface. |
| Stack/collection/vertical/alternatives grids | PASS | Project helper functions require local `project.status === "published"` for listed projects. |
| Submitted/pending/quarantined/scouted/rejected records | PASS | Built sitemap contains no such route states; registries expose only published entries. |
| Admin/API/MCP/payment routes | PASS | Built sitemap deny scan found no admin/API/MCP/payment paths. |
| GitHub mirror output | PASS | Dry-run output stayed under `/tmp`, generated 6 files, and reported no external write or data repo mutation. |
| Data repo | PASS | `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` stayed clean and was only checked read-only. |

## IndexNow / Google Indexing API Review

| Requirement | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR78 boundary exists | PASS | Boundary doc and JSON contract exist. |
| PR79 dry-run QA exists | PASS | `docs/PR79_INDEXNOW_DRY_RUN_SITEMAP_NOTIFICATION_QA.md` exists. |
| IndexNow live ping disabled by default | PASS | `npm run sitemap-notification:check` passed. |
| Google Indexing API forbidden | PASS | Boundary checker passed and no runtime endpoint call site was found. |
| No external search notification happened | PASS | PR80 ran local static/build checks only; no live ping command was executed. |
| No committed key material | PASS | Static search found no committed IndexNow key material in runtime/indexing paths. |
| Denied URL sources | PASS | Boundary contract denies submitted, pending, quarantined, scouted, rejected, admin, API, MCP, and payment sources. |

## GitHub Mirror Dry-Run Review

The PR76 generator was run with:

```bash
node scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs --dry-run --source local --out /tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr80 --no-write-external
```

Result:

- mode: `local-only-dry-run`
- source: `local`
- `externalWrite: false`
- `dataRepoMutation: false`
- generated files: 6
- output location: `/tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr80`

No generated mirror files were committed.

## Findings

- P0: none.
- P1: none.
- P2: none.
- P3: none.

## Sidecar Issues

None.

## What This QA Does Not Do

PR80 does not:

- implement product code;
- create new routes;
- modify app runtime;
- modify sitemap runtime;
- deploy;
- run live smoke;
- ping IndexNow;
- call Google Indexing API;
- contact external search engines;
- expose Public API or MCP changes;
- touch payment behavior;
- install dependencies;
- mutate `88cn-index-data`;
- start PR81.

## Next Phase Recommendation

PR81 should not start directly from PR80. `TRAIN-PR81-PR100` exists but currently contains reserved/checkpointed future tasks and explicit human checkpoints for Laravel, API key, metering, payment, server, or data-feed work.

Recommended next step after PR80 merge and cleanup: OPS7A / PR81-PR100 readiness scan and roadmap task registration before any PR81 implementation.
