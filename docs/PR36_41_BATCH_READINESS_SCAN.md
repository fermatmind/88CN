# PR35 Live QA Rerun + PR36-PR41 Readiness Refresh

## Result

LIVE PASS

PR35 is now complete after production was redeployed from current `origin/main`. The founder intent report route returns 200 on the live site, the live sitemap contains the published report URL, and both generic and PR35-specific live smoke checks pass.

PR36-PR41 remain registered as full roadmap task objects. They can proceed in sequence after this PR35 live gate.

## PR35 Live QA Evidence

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run agent:smoke:live` | PASS | `/api/healthz`, `/`, `/projects`, `/submit`, `/geo-checker`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, and `/admin` returned 200 |
| PR35-specific live smoke | PASS | `EXTRA_PATHS='/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026' REQUIRED_SITEMAP_PATHS='/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026' scripts/agent/smoke-live.sh` passed |
| Live PR34 report page | PASS | `https://88cn.com/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026` returned 200 |

## Main Repository Gate Validation

Refresh-specific validation:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:smoke:live` | PASS |
| `EXTRA_PATHS='/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026' REQUIRED_SITEMAP_PATHS='/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026' scripts/agent/smoke-live.sh` | PASS |
| `curl https://88cn.com/reports/early-ai-project-machine-readability-2026` | PASS, 200 |
| `curl https://88cn.com/sitemap.xml` | PASS, 200 |
| `curl https://88cn.com/sitemap.xml` report entry check | PASS |

## Data Repository Gate Validation

No data repo files were modified. No data repo validation was required for this PR35 live QA rerun.

## Batchability Analysis

Current batch verdict: READY FOR PR36 SEQUENTIAL START.

Reasons:

1. PR35 live report page returns 200.
2. PR35 live sitemap entry exists.
3. PR36 depends on PR35 and can now start.
4. PR37, PR38, PR39, PR40, and PR41 remain sequentially dependent and should not run in parallel unless dependencies are explicitly revised.

## Sidecar Findings

| Severity | Finding | Status | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | PR35 live report route returned 404 before production redeploy | RESOLVED | No action needed |
| P1 | PR35 report URL was missing from live sitemap before production redeploy | RESOLVED | No action needed |
| P2 | Generic live smoke alone did not cover the PR35 report route | RESOLVED BY PROCESS | Use PR-specific `EXTRA_PATHS` and `REQUIRED_SITEMAP_PATHS` for future live QA |
| P2 | PR36-PR41 were registered but gated on PR35 | RESOLVED | Start PR36 sequentially |

No separate `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md` is required; sidecar findings are captured here.

## Recommended Next Action

1. Merge this PR35 live QA rerun.
2. Start PR36: Founder Intent Report Archive + Index Hardening v0.
3. For future live QA tasks that add public indexable routes, run generic live smoke plus route-specific `EXTRA_PATHS` and sitemap-specific `REQUIRED_SITEMAP_PATHS`.

## Exact Proposed Next Train Command

```bash
/goal PR36 Founder Intent Report Archive + Index Hardening v0
```
