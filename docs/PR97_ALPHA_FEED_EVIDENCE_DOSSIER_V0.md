# PR97 Alpha Feed Evidence Dossier v0

## Purpose

PR97 summarizes repo-verifiable evidence for the 88CN Alpha Feed boundary after
PR95 and PR96. The dossier is evidence-only. It does not launch a data product,
runtime feed, buyer collection flow, customer access flow, payment path, API
credential runtime, metering runtime, Laravel runtime, Supabase sync, external
delivery, deployment, or data repository write.

## Scope

This dossier uses only files already present in the 88CN repository and the
local validation commands run for PR97. It summarizes completed PR81 through
PR96 boundary, snapshot, cleansing, API credential, metering, Laravel gateway,
sync, landing, and buyer-interest work.

Changed PR97 files:

- `docs/PR97_ALPHA_FEED_EVIDENCE_DOSSIER_V0.md`
- `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md`
- `docs/TASK_STATUS.md`
- `ops/tasks/current.json`

## Non-Goals

PR97 does not:

- create or modify app runtime code;
- create a public route, API route, customer portal, or feed endpoint;
- collect private contact data or buyer messages;
- write to Supabase;
- connect CRM, email, webhook, payment, or external delivery providers;
- enable API credential issuance or live metering;
- create Laravel, Composer, PHP, Redis production, server, or deploy config;
- mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- start PR98.

## What Alpha Feed Means In 88CN

88CN Alpha Feed is a future public-signal data product concept. At this stage it
is not a live paid feed, not a financial product, not investment advice, not a
regulated offering, not a pooled investment vehicle, not a private-data broker,
and not a promise of ranking, traffic, revenue, citations, financing, or
customer acquisition.

The current implementation preserves disabled-by-default boundaries for payment,
API credentials, metering, buyer-interest collection, Laravel gateway, Supabase
webhook sync, and external data delivery.

Any future customer access, private contact-data collection, billing, API
credential issuance, live metering, Laravel runtime, Supabase webhook, Redis
production use, or external delivery requires a separate human checkpoint.

## Public Signal Corpus Evidence

PR81 and PR82 define Alpha Feed inputs as reviewed local public records only.
PR82 limits future snapshot fields to explicit public fields such as project
slug, project name, canonical URL, category, technology tags, reviewed public
source links, published status, public profile URL, machine-readability summary,
last reviewed timestamp, and public changelog summary.

PR84 implements only a local dry-run exporter and PR86 records a dry-run QA pass
with five published demo records written under `/tmp/88cn-alpha-snapshot-*`.
That evidence demonstrates field-shape and local-output behavior only. It does
not claim market adoption, buyer demand, external search performance, or
production feed availability.

## Data Boundary Evidence

`ops/contracts/alpha-feed-boundary.json` and
`ops/contracts/published-signal-snapshot-schema.json` keep the future feed on a
published-only, allowlisted field model. PR81, PR82, PR83, PR85, and PR86 all
state that raw database rows, private founder/contact fields, admin review
material, payment state, API credential fields, metering fields, private
telemetry, Source Confidence internals, and Signal Score internals are denied.

Unknown facts must remain unknown. Missing values must not be filled with
invented data.

## Privacy And Redaction Evidence

The boundary documents deny private founder, submitter, claim, contact, admin,
review, payment, API credential, metering, raw payload, and private telemetry
fields. PR96 adds a disabled buyer-interest shell whose preview inputs are
disabled, read-only, and have no collection names. The matching route returns a
disabled Problem Details response and does not parse request bodies.

PR97 validation includes `npm run agent:redact:check`.

## Snapshot And Cleansing Evidence

PR84 provides a local-only dry-run exporter that requires `--dry-run`, writes
only under `/tmp/88cn-alpha-snapshot-*`, rejects repository output paths, rejects
the data repository path, rejects URL-style external destinations, and rejects
non-local sources.

PR85 defines duplicate, canonical URL, freshness, archive, source-failure, and
source-conflict rules. PR86 QA confirms the exporter and cleansing contract
without committing generated output to this repository or to
`/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`.

## API Credential And Metering Disabled Evidence

PR87 defines a disabled-by-default API credential and metering boundary. PR88
adds a disabled shell route at `/api/alpha-feed/api-keys`; both GET and POST
return `503 application/problem+json` and no credential material. PR89 defines a
contract-only usage-accounting ledger. PR90 verifies the combined API
credential and metering train, including disabled route smoke and runtime leak
review.

No API credential issuance, live metering, billing, payment, customer access,
Supabase migration, Laravel runtime, dependency, external service, deployment,
or data repo mutation is claimed by those PRs.

## Laravel Gateway And Sync Boundary Evidence

PR91 defines the Laravel gateway as a future boundary only. PR92 adds static
disabled scaffold files under `gateway/` and a local checker, but no Laravel
application. PR93 defines a one-way Supabase webhook sync boundary only. PR94 QA
verifies the closed PR91-PR93 train and records no Laravel runtime, Composer
files, PHP runtime, Supabase migration, webhook runtime, webhook secret, Redis
production config, server config, deploy, customer access, API credential
runtime, metering runtime, external service call, or data repo mutation.

## Buyer-Interest Disabled/No-Write Evidence

PR95 adds the static `/alpha-feed` boundary page. PR96 adds a disabled
buyer-interest shell and `/api/alpha-feed/buyer-interest`, which returns HTTP
`503` with `application/problem+json`. PR96 documentation records that the page
does not collect names, private contact details, company details, phone details,
buyer messages, private founder data, or customer records, and that the route
does not parse request bodies.

## Public Copy And Restricted-Language Boundary

Public and dossier copy must remain factual and bounded. This dossier does not
claim active paying customers, buyer demand, investor demand, outside
endorsement, revenue, traffic, search ranking, AI citation, predictive
investment signal, financial advice, private dataset access, live API access,
production Alpha Feed availability, external MCP release, or live Laravel
gateway service.

The repo-wide `policy:scan` forbids several restricted public-copy literals
outside allowlisted policy files. PR97 therefore uses policy-safe equivalent
phrasing for restricted examples rather than repeating those literals in this
dossier.

## What Remains Unlaunched

The following remain unlaunched:

- live Alpha Feed delivery;
- customer access;
- buyer-interest collection;
- payment or billing;
- API credential issuance;
- live metering;
- Laravel runtime;
- Supabase webhook runtime;
- Redis production use;
- external data delivery;
- production deployment for Alpha Feed access.

## What This Dossier Does Not Claim

This dossier does not claim:

- paying customers or buyer demand;
- investor demand or outside institutional use;
- revenue, traffic, ranking, citation, financing, or customer-growth outcomes;
- approval or endorsement from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or any external
  platform;
- private founder data access;
- live API, MCP, Laravel, or feed availability;
- that any future commercial or customer-access pathway is approved.

## Validation Matrix

PR97 validation:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify:day0` | PASS |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:redact:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:tool:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:mcp-config:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:plugin-policy:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:batch:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:train-plan:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- PR97` | PASS |
| `npm run lint` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `npm run build` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:gate` | PASS |
| `node scripts/agent/train-plan-check.mjs --batch TRAIN-PR98-PR100-B2B-ALPHA-QA-READINESS` | PASS |
| Data repo cleanliness check | PASS |

PR97 cannot add `scripts/check-alpha-feed-evidence-dossier.mjs` because the
roadmap forbids `scripts/**` and `package.json`.

## Sidecar Issues

PR97 records one P3 sidecar: no dedicated PR97 checker is added because PR97 is
docs/status scope only and forbids script and package changes. Validation uses
repo-wide gates, scope guard, redaction guard, policy scan, train-plan checks,
build, and manual static review of this dossier.

## Next Recommended Step

After PR97 merges and post-merge cleanup completes, stop before PR98. The next
train, `TRAIN-PR98-PR100-B2B-ALPHA-QA-READINESS`, should be dry-run checked
from clean `main` before any PR98 work starts.
