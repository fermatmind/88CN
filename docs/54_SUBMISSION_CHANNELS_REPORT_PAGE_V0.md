# Submission Channels Report Page v0

## Summary

PR47 adds a public founder field report at `/reports/ai-project-submission-channels-2026`. The page explains practical AI project submission and announcement surfaces without turning the page into a marketplace, directory scrape, or automated posting workflow.

## What Is Included

- A static report page under `app/reports/ai-project-submission-channels-2026`.
- A structured report data module under `lib/reports/submission-channels-report.ts`.
- Published report registry inclusion through `lib/reports/published-reports.ts`.
- A reports index card linking to the guide.
- `npm run submission-channels:check` to verify copy and boundary controls.

## Boundary Rules

- Use only original 88CN guidance.
- Prefer curated, reviewed, high-signal surfaces.
- Link to `/submit`, `/geo-checker`, and public profile flows.
- Keep sitemap inclusion intentional through the published report registry.
- Do not copy third-party directory descriptions, screenshots, logos, or datasets.
- Do not imply external placement, business results, paid influence, or automated distribution.
