# TRAFFIC3Q Sector Density / Market Map QA v0

## Result

PASS_WITH_FINDINGS

TRAFFIC3Q verifies the TRAFFIC3B sector-density module as a module-only `/landscape` addition. Build, source inspection, sitemap inspection, local boundary checkers, and data-repo cleanliness pass. Browser visual QA was not opened because `scripts/codex-preflight.sh` failed before browser access; this is recorded as a non-blocking QA limitation in `docs/BUILD_ERRORS.md`.

## Route QA

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/landscape` route exists | PASS | `app/landscape/page.tsx` exists and `npm run build` prerenders `/landscape`. |
| Sector-density module exists on `/landscape` | PASS | `Sector density map` module appears in `app/landscape/page.tsx`. |
| `/landscape/sectors` route absent | PASS | `app/landscape/sectors` does not exist. |
| Individual sector pages absent | PASS | No sector route directory or dynamic sector route exists. |
| `/tasks` route absent | PASS | `app/tasks` does not exist. |
| `/zh-CN` route absent | PASS | `app/zh-CN` does not exist. |
| API/MCP/payment/customer route additions | PASS | TRAFFIC3Q diff contains no product files, and TRAFFIC3B module links only existing project pages. |

## Copy QA

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewed-sample wording present | PASS | Page copy says counts are reviewed sample counts. |
| Sparse sectors labeled | PASS | Module copy and helper use `limited reviewed sample` / `limited reviewed samples`. |
| Global market count claims absent | PASS | Module copy says counts are not global market estimates. |
| Complete market coverage claims absent | PASS | No complete-market or complete-coverage claim appears in module copy. |
| Investment/financial/startup advice absent | PASS | Module copy does not include opportunity, ROI, funding, financial advice, or "you should build here" language. |
| Best/top/ranking/superiority claims absent | PASS | The only ranking-related source phrase is a negative boundary sentence: "not a ranking page." |
| Traffic/revenue/customer/funding estimates absent | PASS | No such estimates are rendered by the module. |
| Unsupported open-source/commercial split absent | PASS | Helper methodology states the split is not shown until source-backed fields exist. |

## Count / Density QA

| Sector | Reviewed sample count | Threshold label | QA result |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| AI builder infrastructure | 3 | meets basic threshold | PASS |
| Model and search infrastructure | 2 | limited reviewed sample | PASS |
| Analytics and operations tools | 2 | limited reviewed sample | PASS |
| Local and on-device productivity | 1 | limited reviewed sample | PASS |

Counts are derived from finite local project records via `getProjectBySlug` and lifecycle-filtered to `published`, `claimed`, or `owner_verified`. Source evidence is limited to source-linked websites, GitHub links, and docs links from reviewed local records.

## Sitemap QA

Built sitemap artifact inspected: `.next/server/app/sitemap.xml.body`.

| Sitemap path family | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `/landscape` | PRESENT |
| `/landscape/sectors` | absent |
| `/landscape/sectors/*` | absent |
| `/tasks` and `/tasks/*` | absent |
| `/zh-CN` | absent |
| API/MCP/payment/customer/buyer-interest routes | absent |

## Checker Results

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify:day0` | PASS |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:redact:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- TRAFFIC3Q` | PASS |
| `npm run lint` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `npm run build` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:gate` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` | PASS |
| `npm run landscape:check` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-sector-density-boundary.mjs` | PASS |

## Browser QA

Not run. `scripts/codex-preflight.sh` failed before browser access because `http://localhost:3000/api/healthz` was not serving on port 3000. Per repo instruction, no browser was opened after preflight failure. The failure is recorded in `docs/BUILD_ERRORS.md`.

## Data Repo Cleanliness

`/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` is clean on `main...origin/main` after `git pull --ff-only origin main`.

## Findings By Severity

- P0: none.
- P1: none.
- P2: none.
- P3: browser visual QA was unavailable because the required Codex preflight failed before browser access. Build/static/sitemap/checker evidence passed, and no screenshot artifacts were written.

## Sidecar Issues

No new sidecar issue was opened. The browser-preflight limitation is recorded in `docs/BUILD_ERRORS.md` because that is the file written by the preflight script and is allowed by TRAFFIC3Q scope.

## Exact Next Recommended Task

TRAFFIC4 Task-to-Project Discovery v0.

Do not start TRAFFIC4 from TRAFFIC3Q.

## What This QA Does Not Do

- Does not modify product code.
- Does not modify `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, or `scripts/**`.
- Does not create `/landscape/sectors`, individual sector pages, `/tasks`, or `/zh-CN`.
- Does not modify API, MCP, payment, customer, Supabase, deployment, package metadata, public assets, or data repo files.
- Does not run browser QA after the failed Codex browser preflight.
- Does not start TRAFFIC4, GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, OPS9B, or PR101.
