# TRAFFIC0R Public Monetization Boundary Audit

## Audit Boundary

This audit records public-page evidence only. It does not infer private backend architecture, hidden ranking logic, private ad systems, database state, or search guideline compliance.

Neutral labels used:

- public evidence observed
- not observed
- unclear from public pages
- risk pattern for 88CN

88CN comparison principle:

Featured Signals may affect human-visible UI only. Featured Signals must not affect sitemap inclusion, Public API ordering, MCP payloads, Signal Score, Source Confidence, organic route ordering, or editorial review result.

## Competitor Audit Matrix

| Site | Featured / sponsored / promoted labels | Advertise / sponsor / submit / pricing CTA | Paid/organic separation visible? | rel=sponsored / nofollow observed? | Ranking mixed with paid placement? | Traffic/ranking claims in paid copy? | 88CN lesson |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| toolify.ai | Sponsored and featured labels observed on homepage/ranking surfaces | Submit and advertise links visible; submit form visible | Unclear from public pages; sponsored cards visibly labeled but ranking interaction is not fully auditable | rel=nofollow observed on many outbound revenue-ranking links; rel=sponsored not observed | Unclear from public pages | Revenue/monthly visits/ranking framing visible on public ranking routes | Do not use unverified traffic/revenue/ranking framing. Paid UI must not affect organic systems. |
| futurepedia.io | Featured/advertise/review language observed; editorial guidelines visible | Submit page and charge rationale visible | Better than most because editorial guidelines are public, but exact paid/organic separation still not fully knowable | rel=nofollow observed on some outbound links; rel=sponsored not observed | Unclear from public pages | Reach/audience framing visible on submit page | 88CN should publish review/lifecycle rules and keep any paid surface isolated. |
| futuretools.io | Not prominent in sampled pages | Submit form visible; newsletter distribution visible | Unclear from sampled pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Not observed | Not observed in sampled pages | Curation/newsletter can be safe if it does not promise outcomes. |
| aixploria.com | Featured/verified/top/best language observed | Submit/featured page visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=nofollow observed; rel=sponsored not observed | Unclear from public pages | Audience/reach framing visible on featured page | 88CN should avoid broad top/best framing and separate featured UI clearly. |
| aitoolsdirectory.com | Featured Tools Premium Placement visible | Submit Tool and Advertise visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Unclear from public pages | Premium placement language visible | 88CN should not let premium placement language touch discovery trust. |
| AI工具集 / ai-bot.cn | Advertising/cooperation language visible | Advertising cooperation and inclusion/update links visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=nofollow observed; rel=sponsored not observed | Unclear from public pages | Not observed as ranking claim in sampled pages | 88CN Chinese submit pages must avoid paid inclusion confusion. |
| AIBase / top.aibase.com | Promotion/ranking/submission signals visible | Submit/product display page visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=nofollow observed; rel=sponsored not observed | Ranking and submission coexist publicly, but hidden logic is not auditable | GEO/promotion and ranking language visible in ecosystem | 88CN must frame GEO as readiness/machine readability, not promotional outcome. |
| aibase.com | Business cooperation visible | Partnership and GEO checker pages visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Not observed in sampled pages | Promotion-effect language visible on GEO checker | Avoid outcome-oriented checker copy. |
| AI导航网 / ainav.cn | Advertising/business cooperation visible | Submit and business cooperation forms visible | Some sampled tool-detail outbound links used rel=sponsored | rel=sponsored and rel=nofollow observed on sampled detail page | Unclear from public pages | Not observed as ranking claim in sampled detail | Good reminder to make paid/link treatment explicit and not affect organic routes. |
| AIGC导航 / aigc.cn | Submit/contact/认证 language visible | Submit/contact visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=nofollow observed; rel=sponsored not observed | Not observed | Not observed | Submit instructions can exist, but lifecycle and review boundaries must be explicit. |
| 发现AI / faxianai.com | Ranking, ad, promotion language visible | Ranking/hotnews/tool cards visible | Unclear from public pages | Many nofollow outbound links observed on hotnews; rel=sponsored not observed | Unclear from public pages | Ranking/hotness language visible | 88CN should avoid ranking pages until source and counts are defensible. |
| ToolifyAi Chinese | Submit, ad/news language visible | Submit link and inputs visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Unclear from public pages | Not observed | Generic Chinese directory monetization patterns reinforce need for differentiation. |
| 360AI导航 | Ad signal visible on detail pages | Feedback/login/collection links visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Not observed | Not observed | Portal-style ads should not define 88CN's trust model. |
| 鱼皮AI导航 | Business cooperation visible | Business cooperation link visible | Unclear from public pages | rel=sponsored/nofollow not observed in sampled summary | Not observed | Not observed | Builder community monetization should stay separate from project evidence. |
| SaaSHub | Not observed due minimal render | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | No conclusion from TRAFFIC0R page sample. |
| AlternativeTo | Not observed due minimal render | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | Not observed | No conclusion from TRAFFIC0R page sample. |

## TRAFFIC1 Monetization Inputs

TRAFFIC1 should add `monetization_boundary` to every route family:

- `none`: pure editorial/source-backed route
- `featured_ui_only`: paid/featured visual label allowed, no organic-system effect
- `forbidden`: route cannot contain monetization surface
- `checkpoint_required`: future paid surface requires human checkpoint

Suggested initial defaults:

- `/landscape`: `none`
- `/landscape/sectors`: `none`
- `/tasks/[slug]`: `none`
- `/alternatives/[slug]`: `none`
- `/zh-CN/landscape`: `none`
- `/zh-CN/geo-checker`: `forbidden`
- `/zh-CN/founders`: `none`
- `/zh-CN/submit`: `checkpoint_required` for any commercial surface
- report distribution pages: `none` unless a later human checkpoint approves a separate sponsorship boundary
