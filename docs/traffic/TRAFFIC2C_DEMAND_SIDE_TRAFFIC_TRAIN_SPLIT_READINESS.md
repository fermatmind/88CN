# TRAFFIC2C Demand-Side Traffic Train Split + Readiness Scan v0

Result: GO_TRAFFIC3_ONLY

Date: 2026-06-20

Role: codex-build / codex-research

## Scope

TRAFFIC2C verifies TRAFFIC2B closure, scans TRAFFIC3-TRAFFIC7 and GROWTH0-GROWTH3, classifies next-task risk, checks train runner compatibility for non-PR task IDs, and recommends the next demand-side traffic step.

This is readiness, roadmap, and status work only. It does not implement TRAFFIC3, TRAFFIC4, TRAFFIC5, TRAFFIC6, TRAFFIC7, GROWTH0, GROWTH1, GROWTH2, GROWTH3, BETA1, I18N0, PR101, public routes, app code, runtime code, runner scripts, deployment, external posting, email, DM, CRM write, PII collection, Supabase write, or data repository mutation.

## Repository State

- Main repository: `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88CN`
- Current branch at preflight: `main`
- Current main SHA: `75bacb4971dbd135b05223583a106098342ef4c4`
- `main == origin/main`: yes
- Worktree clean at preflight: yes
- `ops/tasks/current.json`: retained at TRAFFIC2B/PASS because the existing TRAFFIC2B landscape checker asserts that state; TRAFFIC2C status is recorded in this report and `docs/TASK_STATUS.md`.
- Data repository: `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`
- Data repository state: clean on `main...origin/main`

## TRAFFIC2B Completion Verification

TRAFFIC2B closure is verified:

- PR #130 merged at `4333d8a7e72d989f93da62d820296b3c493e06ad`.
- PR #131 checker post-merge fix merged at `75bacb4971dbd135b05223583a106098342ef4c4`.
- Both merge commits are ancestors of `origin/main`.
- `app/landscape/page.tsx` exists.
- `/landscape` is implemented as a reviewed public-signal navigation hub.
- `scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` exists.
- `package.json` registers `landscape:check`.
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` passes.
- `npm run landscape:check` passes.
- Built route output includes `/landscape`.
- Built sitemap evidence includes `/landscape`.
- Built sitemap evidence does not include `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, or `/landscape/sectors`.
- Filesystem checks confirm no `app/tasks`, `app/zh-CN`, or `app/landscape/sectors`.
- No API, MCP, payment, customer, or buyer-interest routes were added by TRAFFIC2B.
- No Supabase write, deploy, or data repository mutation occurred.
- TRAFFIC3, GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, and PR101 remain unstarted.

## Current /landscape Validation Status

Baseline validation passed before this readiness scan:

- `npm run verify:day0`
- `npm run policy:scan`
- `npm run third-party:check`
- `npm run agent:redact:check`
- `npm run agent:batch:check`
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run agent:gate`
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`
- `npm run landscape:check`

The route remains a bounded navigation hub. It does not create sector pages, task pages, Chinese-language routes, live feeds, account enrollment, or commercial workflow routes.

## TRAFFIC2C Validation Results

TRAFFIC2C local validation passed:

- `npm run verify:day0`
- `npm run policy:scan`
- `npm run third-party:check`
- `npm run agent:redact:check`
- `npm run agent:batch:check`
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`
- `npm run agent:scope:check -- TRAFFIC2C`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run agent:gate`
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`
- `npm run landscape:check`

Data repository cleanliness passed:

- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` status: clean on `main...origin/main`

## TRAFFIC3-TRAFFIC7 Task Matrix

| Task | Current title | Current type | Current scope | Risk | Split recommendation | Batchability | Auto-merge | Wait conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TRAFFIC3 | Sector Density / Market Map v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only; no app paths | Medium | No split before current TRAFFIC3. Use TRAFFIC3 as boundary/research task, then decide whether TRAFFIC3B implementation and TRAFFIC3Q QA are needed. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes if checks pass | Does not need deploy first. |
| TRAFFIC4 | Task-to-Project Discovery v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only; no `/tasks` implementation | High SEO/pSEO | Keep current TRAFFIC4 as boundary. Future implementation should be split into finite implementation and QA. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes for docs-only boundary | Wait for TRAFFIC3 output and explicit task-page boundary. |
| TRAFFIC5 | Alternatives Expansion Boundary v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only; no alternatives expansion implementation | High comparison/canonical | Keep current TRAFFIC5 as boundary. Future implementation should be split from QA and require canonical pair rules. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes for docs-only boundary | Wait for TRAFFIC4 boundary and explicit implementation approval. |
| TRAFFIC6 | Report Distribution Pack Generator v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only; no sending or posting | Medium automation | May remain single docs/tooling-boundary task if it stays local-draft only. Implementation, if any, should be local output only. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes for docs-only boundary | Must keep external writes disabled. |
| TRAFFIC7 | Demand-Side Traffic QA v0 | research / QA | Docs/status/roadmap QA only | Low/Medium | Safe as train closer after TRAFFIC3-TRAFFIC6 artifacts exist. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes if QA-only | Wait until prior traffic tasks are complete. |

## GROWTH0-GROWTH3 Task Matrix

| Task | Current title | Current type | Current scope | Risk | Split recommendation | Batchability | Auto-merge | Wait conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GROWTH0 | Growth Agent Boundary Scan v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only | Medium | Must run before GROWTH1 or GROWTH2. No split required if it stays boundary-only. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes for docs-only boundary | Wait until demand-side traffic scope is clearer or explicitly reprioritized. |
| GROWTH1 | Founder Acquisition Agent v0 | future-checkpointed | Docs/status/roadmap only | High outreach/PII | Do not implement before GROWTH0. Future implementation must be drafts-only and human-owned. | Single-run only under current runner | Not as implementation; docs-only may pass | Wait for GROWTH0 and human checkpoint. |
| GROWTH2 | Report Distribution Agent v0 | future-checkpointed | Docs/status/roadmap only | High external-write | Do not implement before GROWTH0. Future implementation must not post, send, log in, or store contacts. | Single-run only under current runner | Not as implementation; docs-only may pass | Wait for GROWTH0 and human checkpoint. |
| GROWTH3 | Weekly Growth Review Generator v0 | research | Docs/status/roadmap only | Medium analytics | Can remain single if it uses repo-safe and manually supplied aggregate metrics only. | Single-run only under current runner | Yes for docs-only boundary | Wait for GROWTH0; no live analytics connection. |

## Risk Classification

### TRAFFIC3

TRAFFIC3 is ready to start as currently registered because it is docs-only research with no app paths, no sitemap changes, no route implementation, and no deployment. It should define sector-density rules, reviewed-sample language, threshold policy, and future implementation guardrails.

Risk remains medium for later implementation because sector pages can accidentally imply full market coverage, fake density, thin content, or sitemap eligibility before thresholds are met.

### TRAFFIC4

TRAFFIC4 is high risk for later implementation because task pages can drift into arbitrary dynamic params, mass generated pages, thin task intent pages, unsupported claims, and sitemap blow-up. Current TRAFFIC4 is docs-only and safe to run later, but implementation should require a boundary before any `/tasks` route exists.

### TRAFFIC5

TRAFFIC5 is high risk for later implementation because alternatives can drift into N-by-N expansion, reverse-pair duplication, superiority framing, thin comparison copy, or hidden commercial bias. Current TRAFFIC5 is boundary-only and safe to scan later, but app work should wait for canonical-pair enforcement.

### TRAFFIC6

TRAFFIC6 is medium risk. It can be safe if it remains local draft generation only with no social posting, email send, DM send, external write, platform login, CRM write, PII storage, or browser-session export.

### TRAFFIC7

TRAFFIC7 is low/medium risk as QA-only. It should close the demand-side traffic sequence by verifying `/landscape`, any sector/task/alternatives surfaces that exist by then, sitemap, canonical, noindex, public copy, mobile behavior, disabled route safety, and generic-directory drift.

### Growth Tasks

GROWTH0 is the required boundary before any growth agent implementation. GROWTH1 and GROWTH2 are high risk unless constrained to human-owned drafts with no sending, posting, CRM write, contact storage, or external service use. GROWTH3 can be safe if it uses manually supplied aggregate metrics and does not connect live analytics or collect PII.

## Split Recommendation

Decision: `GO_TRAFFIC3_ONLY`.

TRAFFIC3 is currently a docs-only boundary/research task, not an implementation task. It does not create `/landscape/sectors`, sitemap entries, app code, runtime code, or public pages. It is safe as the exact next single task after TRAFFIC2C.

Do not start a multi-task TRAFFIC train yet. Current batch tooling cannot safely register non-PR task batches, and TRAFFIC4/TRAFFIC5 implementation risks should be handled only after their boundary outputs are clear.

Recommended future split after TRAFFIC3:

- TRAFFIC3B Sector Density / Market Map Implementation v0, only if TRAFFIC3 defines finite reviewed thresholds and route policy.
- TRAFFIC3Q Sector Density / Market Map QA v0, only after any implementation PR.
- TRAFFIC4A/B/Q style split before any `/tasks` implementation.
- TRAFFIC5A/B/Q style split before alternatives expansion implementation.

## Batch Runner Compatibility Finding

Current batch runner compatibility result: non-PR task batches are not supported.

Evidence:

- `scripts/agent/batch-check.mjs` validates each batch task ID with `^PR\\d+$`.
- `ops/trains/batches.json` currently contains PR-number trains only.
- `npm run agent:batch:check` passes with the existing PR-number train registry.
- Registering TRAFFIC/GROWTH task IDs in `ops/trains/batches.json` would violate the current validator.

Recommendation:

- Do not modify `ops/trains/batches.json` in TRAFFIC2C.
- Keep TRAFFIC/GROWTH execution as single-task PRs for now.
- If continuous non-PR traffic/growth trains are required, create a separate runner compatibility task:

`OPS9A Non-PR Task Batch Runner Compatibility v0`

That task should update runner validation and train registry rules in its own scoped PR.

## Proposed Next Sequence

Immediate next task:

1. TRAFFIC3 Sector Density / Market Map v0

Likely later sequence:

1. TRAFFIC3 boundary/research.
2. Optional TRAFFIC3B implementation only if boundary says route thresholds are safe.
3. Optional TRAFFIC3Q QA if implementation happens.
4. TRAFFIC4 boundary before any `/tasks` route.
5. TRAFFIC5 boundary before alternatives expansion implementation.
6. TRAFFIC6 local-draft distribution boundary or generator, with no external writes.
7. TRAFFIC7 QA closer.

GROWTH0 should remain after the demand-side traffic boundary is clearer unless the human team explicitly reprioritizes growth-agent boundary work.

## Deployment Timing Recommendation

Recommendation: deploy after TRAFFIC7, unless the human team wants a smaller checkpoint release after TRAFFIC3.

Reasoning:

- `/landscape` is implemented and locally validated, but TRAFFIC3-TRAFFIC6 will determine whether additional demand-side surfaces exist.
- Deploying after TRAFFIC7 gives one QA closure across `/landscape`, any sector/task/alternatives surfaces that may be added later, sitemap, canonical, noindex, and copy boundaries.
- If the team wants a smaller earlier release, use a separate human-checkpointed deploy task after TRAFFIC3 only:

`OPS9B Demand-Side Traffic Surface Deploy + Live Smoke v0`

Do not start OPS9B from TRAFFIC2C.

## I18N / Beta / PR101 Pause Recommendation

- I18N0 should stay paused until beta feedback or explicit human reprioritization.
- BETA1 should stay paused unless the human team is ready to run manual tester outreach and feedback handling.
- PR101 remains paused and should not be started from the traffic readiness lane.
- GROWTH0 should not start before TRAFFIC3 unless explicitly reprioritized.

## Key Question Answers

1. TRAFFIC3 is ready to start after TRAFFIC2B and TRAFFIC2C.
2. TRAFFIC3 is currently docs-only research, not implementation.
3. TRAFFIC3 currently modifies only docs/status/roadmap, not `/landscape/sectors`.
4. TRAFFIC3 does not need a split before the current docs-only task; future implementation and QA should be split.
5. TRAFFIC3 does not require sitemap changes as currently registered.
6. TRAFFIC3 should define noindex and threshold logic for any future sector route.
7. TRAFFIC4 is too risky to run immediately as implementation, but its current boundary task can run after TRAFFIC3.
8. TRAFFIC4 task pages require a boundary before implementation.
9. TRAFFIC4 should enforce finite task slugs and at least 3 reviewed/published projects before indexable pages.
10. TRAFFIC5 alternatives expansion should require boundary before implementation.
11. TRAFFIC5 needs canonical-pair enforcement before app work.
12. TRAFFIC6 can run without external posting only if it stays local-draft or docs-only.
13. TRAFFIC6 should create local drafts only if it reaches tooling scope.
14. TRAFFIC7 is QA-only as registered and safe as a closer after prior traffic tasks.
15. GROWTH0 must run before GROWTH1/GROWTH2.
16. GROWTH1/GROWTH2 are not safe as automation; they are safe only as drafts-only boundary work after GROWTH0.
17. GROWTH3 can use manually supplied aggregates and should not require live analytics.
18. Current batch runner does not support TRAFFIC/GROWTH task IDs in train batches.
19. A separate OPS runner-compatibility task should be created only if non-PR train batching is needed.
20. Exact next task: TRAFFIC3 Sector Density / Market Map v0.
21. Deployment should happen after TRAFFIC7 by default, or after TRAFFIC3 only as a smaller checkpoint if explicitly chosen.
22. I18N0 should stay paused.
23. BETA1 should stay paused.
24. PR101 should stay paused.

## Sidecar Issues

No blocking sidecar issue is opened by TRAFFIC2C.

Non-blocking recommendation:

- Consider `OPS9A Non-PR Task Batch Runner Compatibility v0` if the team wants continuous TRAFFIC/GROWTH train execution rather than one task per PR.
- `scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` still asserts `ops/tasks/current.json` is TRAFFIC2B/PASS. TRAFFIC2C scope forbids `scripts/**`, so this PR leaves `current.json` at TRAFFIC2B/PASS and records TRAFFIC2C completion through the report and task status. A later checker-maintenance task can make the landscape checker lifecycle-aware for post-TRAFFIC2B tasks.

## Exact Next Recommended Task

TRAFFIC3 Sector Density / Market Map v0.

Run TRAFFIC3 as a single docs-only boundary/research task. Do not start TRAFFIC3B, TRAFFIC4, GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, PR101, or OPS9B from TRAFFIC2C.

## What This PR Does Not Do

This PR does not implement product pages, app routes, `/landscape/sectors`, `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, alternatives expansion, growth agents, outreach automation, external writes, email send, DM send, CRM writes, PII storage, deployment, live smoke, Supabase writes, data repository mutation, runner script changes, TRAFFIC3, GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, or PR101.
