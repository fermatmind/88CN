# TRAFFIC2B AI Project Landscape Landing Implementation v0

Result: PASS

Date: 2026-06-20

Role: codex-build

## Scope

TRAFFIC2B implements the bounded `/landscape` route from the TRAFFIC2 handoff. The route is a reviewed public-signal navigation hub for existing 88CN public surfaces. It is not a broad directory clone, ranking page, commercial placement page, live endpoint, buyer capture form, or account enrollment flow.

## Implemented Files

- `app/landscape/page.tsx`
- `lib/landscape/public-signal-landscape.ts`
- `scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`
- `app/sitemap.ts`
- `package.json`
- `docs/traffic/TRAFFIC2B_AI_PROJECT_LANDSCAPE_LANDING_IMPLEMENTATION_V0.md`
- `docs/TASK_STATUS.md`
- `ops/tasks/current.json`

No component directory was needed.

## Route Summary

`/landscape` renders a manually bounded landing page for reviewed AI project public signals. The route uses static local helpers and existing reviewed registries only. It includes safe metadata, a self canonical, index/follow robots metadata, and a sitemap entry for `/landscape` only.

## Page Sections

- Hero with the approved core message: "Explore reviewed AI projects by category, stack, source links, and public readiness signals."
- Boundary panel explaining the page is not a ranking, commercial-placement, live-endpoint, account-enrollment, or generic-directory surface.
- Audience cards for builders, potential founders, researchers/data buyers, and project founders or owners.
- Public signal preview using source-backed local counts only.
- Browse-by section linking to existing safe public surfaces.
- Machine-readability evidence section covering website reachability, GitHub links, docs links, sitemap detection, JSON-LD detection, and canonical detection.
- Reviewed project sample using published or claimed public profiles.
- Founder workflow links to submit, founders, and geo-checker.
- Research workflow links to reports and Alpha Feed evidence.

## Safe Data Source Evidence

`lib/landscape/public-signal-landscape.ts` reads only existing local helpers:

- `getPublishedProjects()`
- `getPublishedStackClusters()`
- `getPublishedCuratedCollections()`
- `getPublishedVerticalAssetGrids()`
- `getPublishedCuratedAlternatives()`
- `getPublishedReportRoutes()`

These helpers are local, reviewed public-surface registries or published project helpers. The landscape helper does not import database clients, admin modules, payment modules, credential modules, metering modules, MCP modules, gateway modules, telemetry modules, or external service clients.

## Forbidden Data Exclusion

The page does not render private founder contact data, internal notes, commercial account state, API credential data, metering data, buyer-interest data, private analytics, raw payloads, raw rows, submitted records, pending records, quarantined records, rejected records, scouted records, or unreviewed claims.

## Lifecycle Filter Evidence

The project sample comes from `getPublishedProjects()`, which filters local demo project records to public-safe lifecycle states:

- `published`
- `claimed`
- `owner_verified`

The implementation does not expose submitted, pending, approved-but-unpublished, quarantined, rejected, scouted, draft-only, private/admin-only, or unreviewed-claim states.

## Sitemap Decision Evidence

`app/sitemap.ts` adds exactly one TRAFFIC2B route:

- `/landscape`

No `/landscape/sectors`, `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, API, MCP, payment, customer, disabled-shell, checker-result, or under-threshold child URL was added.

## Copy Boundary Evidence

The page uses reviewed-sample and public-signal language. It includes the required low-data wording:

> 88CN organizes a reviewed sample of public AI project signals. Counts are not global market estimates.

The route copy avoids superlatives, ranking promises, traffic promises, model-answer promises, paid-inclusion claims, link-value promises, automatic listing language, and copied competitor descriptions.

## Checker Behavior

`scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` is a Node standard-library checker registered as:

```json
"landscape:check": "node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs"
```

It verifies:

- `/landscape` route and landscape helper exist.
- `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, and `/landscape/sectors` are absent.
- No `app/api/**` or `package-lock.json` change is present.
- Landscape files do not import forbidden modules.
- Landscape source copy does not contain forbidden fields or restricted public-copy phrases.
- Low-data wording is present.
- Only safe existing route links are used.
- Sitemap includes `/landscape` and excludes disallowed route families.
- `docs/TASK_STATUS.md` and `ops/tasks/current.json` are updated.
- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` remains clean.

## Validation Results

Local validation passed:

- `npm run verify:day0`
- `npm run policy:scan`
- `npm run third-party:check`
- `npm run agent:redact:check`
- `npm run agent:batch:check`
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`
- `npm run agent:scope:check -- TRAFFIC2B`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run agent:gate`
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`
- `npm run landscape:check`

Data repository cleanliness passed:

- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` status: clean on `main...origin/main`

## What This PR Does Not Do

This PR does not create `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, `/landscape/sectors`, alternatives expansion, API routes, MCP routes, payment routes, customer routes, buyer-interest routes, live endpoints, crawler scripts, external service integrations, public asset dependencies, Supabase writes, data repository mutation, deployment, TRAFFIC3, GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, or PR101 work.

## Exact Next Recommended Task

TRAFFIC3 Sector Density / Market Map v0.

Do not start TRAFFIC3 from this PR. Keep GROWTH0, BETA1, I18N0, and PR101 unstarted until explicitly selected.
