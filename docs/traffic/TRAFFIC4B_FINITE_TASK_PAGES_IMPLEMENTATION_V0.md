# TRAFFIC4B Finite Task Pages Implementation v0

## Result

PASS_FINITE_TASK_ROUTE_ONLY

TRAFFIC4B implements the PR122-approved finite `/tasks/[slug]` route for one first-wave task: `evaluate-ai-builder-infrastructure`. Unknown task slugs are not generated, deferred candidates remain out of sitemap, and the implementation uses reviewed local project records only.

## Scope

- Task ID: PR123 / TRAFFIC4B
- Role: codex-build
- Repo: `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88CN`
- Data repo: `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` cleanliness check only
- Product route: `/tasks/[slug]`
- Deployment: none

## Implemented Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/tasks/task-discovery.ts` | Static task discovery registry, eligibility filters, and project lookup helpers. |
| `app/tasks/[slug]/page.tsx` | Finite static task route with `dynamicParams = false`, metadata, JSON-LD, and reviewed project cards. |
| `app/sitemap.ts` | Adds sitemap entries only from `getPublishedTaskDiscoveryEntries()`. |
| `scripts/check-task-discovery-boundary.mjs` | Local checker for finite route, sitemap, deferred slug, forbidden path, copy, and data repo boundaries. |

## Route Matrix

| Slug | Status | Sitemap | Reviewed sample count | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `evaluate-ai-builder-infrastructure` | published | yes | 3 | Implemented. |
| `review-model-search-infrastructure` | noindex | no | 2 | Deferred; no public route generated. |
| `review-analytics-operations-tools` | noindex | no | 2 | Deferred; no public route generated. |
| `choose-local-on-device-productivity` | noindex | no | 1 | Deferred; no public route generated. |
| `compare-open-source-ai-project-tooling` | noindex | no | 2 | Deferred; no public route generated. |

## Boundary Evidence

- `generateStaticParams()` reads only `getPublishedTaskDiscoveryEntries()`.
- `dynamicParams = false` prevents arbitrary static expansion.
- Unknown or under-threshold entries hit `notFound()`.
- Sitemap entries are derived only from published, sitemap-eligible task entries meeting the minimum reviewed-project threshold.
- Project cards are sourced from existing reviewed local `DemoProject` records and public-safe lifecycle states.
- No `/tasks` index route is created.
- No `/zh-CN/tasks`, `/landscape/sectors`, API, MCP, payment, customer, buyer-interest, or data-feed route is created.
