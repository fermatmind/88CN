# QA Report

## PR203 Frontend No-Leakage QA v0

Result: `PASS_FRONTEND_QA_NO_LEAKAGE`

PR203 verifies the PR199-PR202 frontend MVP public surface:

- `/projects` lists only internal `published_projection` fixture adapter records and exposes only reviewed public projection fields.
- `/projects/[slug]` uses published projection static params and lookup; missing or non-published records fail closed.
- Collections are finite reviewed slugs: `open-source-ai-agents`, `rag-projects`, `ai-outbound`, and `ai-tool-alternatives`.
- Search index and sitemap helpers include only eligible published projection records with canonical slug, source, summary, seo indexability, and blocker checks.
- Public API and MCP remain disabled by existing checks.
- No raw seed, source evidence, audit payload, review note, quarantine/rejected/stale/archived record, private hash, internal confidence, copied competitor copy, ranking/best/top claim, paid influence, deployment, server action, runtime, Redis/queue runtime, Supabase/staging/production write, external outreach, or data repo mutation was found.

Validation: local static/build/gate checks passed. Browser/manual visual QA was not opened because this PR is QA documentation/status only under the goal's no-browser/no-deploy constraints.

## PR198 Worker Boundary QA

Result: `PASS_WORKER_QA_NO_RUNTIME`

PR198 verifies the PR194-PR197 worker pipeline remains no-runtime and local-only:

- no runtime daemon;
- no worker started;
- no queue or Redis runtime started;
- no live external HTTP by default;
- no Playwright, headless browser, browser fallback, WAF bypass, login, cookies, or session use;
- no Supabase/staging/production write;
- no public projection or auto-publish;
- no private seed artifact or raw project rows committed;
- no server/cloud mutation or deploy;
- no package metadata or dependency install path.

Worker repo evidence: `fermatmind/88cn-scout-worker#5`, worker commit `bd8af3c`.

88CN handoff evidence: `docs/infra/WORKER_QA.md`.

## PR192 Control Panel QA v0

Result: `PASS_CONTROL_PANEL_QA_WITH_SERVER_PREP_SIDECAR`

PR192 verifies the merged PR190 / BULK_CONTROL_PANEL and PR191 /
STATE_SWITCHER_REVIEW_LOG lane. The admin bulk review surface remains guarded,
no unreviewed `seed_hint`, `identity_candidate`, `canonical_candidate`,
`review_ready`, `quarantined`, or `rejected` record is exposed to public routes,
raw source/audit/review details remain admin-only, and the state switcher keeps
publication manual with required reason and public-field checks.

No sitemap, Public API, MCP, payment, CRM, email, social, deployment,
server/cloud, worker runtime, or data-repo mutation occurs in PR192. Direct
`landscape:check` remains a recorded TRAFFIC2B lifecycle sidecar for changed
`app/api/**`; PR192 does not modify `scripts/**`.

Stop after PR192. PR188 and PR189 remain `SERVER_PREP_SIDECAR_BLOCKED`, and
PR193+ remains blocked until the server-prep sidecar is resolved or the
dependency is explicitly reworked.

## Latest Run

- Date: 2026-06-20
- Scope: GROWTH4Q Growth Ops No-Auto-Send QA Closer v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS_GROWTH_PHASE_CLOSED
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- GROWTH4Q closes the Growth drafts and no-auto-send train.
- PR #156 through PR #164 merged report distribution, founder acquisition, and weekly review boundary/draft/QA work as docs/status/metadata-only changes.
- No sender code, external post, email send, DM send, platform login, CRM write, PII storage, browser session export, live analytics connection, Supabase write, deploy, or data-repo mutation occurred.
- GROWTHQ remains only a historical alias; GROWTH4Q is the runner-compatible final closer.
- Detailed evidence lives in `docs/growth/GROWTH4Q_GROWTH_OPS_NO_AUTO_SEND_QA_CLOSER_V0.md`.

## Previous Run: PR124 / TRAFFIC4Q Task Pages QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-20
- Scope: PR124 / TRAFFIC4Q Task Pages QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS
- Blocked: No

PR124 verified the PR123 finite `/tasks/[slug]` implementation. Build output included exactly one task page: `/tasks/evaluate-ai-builder-infrastructure`; deferred task candidates remained absent from sitemap and build output; `check-task-discovery-boundary` passed; and the data repository remained clean.

## Previous Run: TRAFFIC3Q Sector Density / Market Map QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-20
- Scope: TRAFFIC3Q Sector Density / Market Map QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS_WITH_FINDINGS
- Blocked: No

TRAFFIC3Q verified the TRAFFIC3B sector-density module on `/landscape`. Build output included `/landscape`; sitemap excluded `/landscape/sectors`, `/tasks`, `/zh-CN`, API, MCP, payment, customer, and buyer-interest routes; `check-landscape-boundary` and `check-sector-density-boundary` passed. Browser visual QA was unavailable because `scripts/codex-preflight.sh` failed before browser access when no local health endpoint was serving. Data repository remained clean.

## Previous Run: PR94 Gateway + Sync Boundary QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Scope: PR94 Gateway + Sync Boundary QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS_WITH_P2_SIDECAR
- Blocked: No P0/P1 blocker; train policy still forbids auto-merge

PR94 verified PR91, PR92, and PR93 as a closed Laravel gateway and Supabase sync boundary train. The run found no P0/P1 blockers, recorded the PR92-scoped Laravel checker lifecycle issue as P2, and stopped before PR95.

## Previous Run: PR90 API Key + Metering QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Scope: PR90 API Key + Metering QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS_WITH_SIDECAR
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- PR90 verifies PR87, PR88, and PR89 as a closed API key and metering boundary train.
- PR87 contract/docs keep API key issuance, customer access, live metering, billing, payment, Supabase migration, Laravel runtime, external service, and data repo mutation disabled.
- PR88 disabled shell returns `503 application/problem+json` for GET/POST `/api/alpha-feed/api-keys` and exposes no key material fields.
- PR89 contract defines disabled default flags, append-only ledger policy, idempotency policy, denied fields/statuses, billing/payment separation, and Public API/MCP/sitemap separation.
- Runtime leak scan found no forbidden metering, usage, billing, customer, Supabase migration, Laravel, Redis production, Stripe, or key-generation implementation.
- Data repository remained clean.
- PR91 was not started.

PR90 can merge under the explicit user approval for PR90 only. After merge and
cleanup, stop before PR91.

## Previous Run: PR80 Global Intent Web QA + Readiness Report v0

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Scope: PR80 Global Intent Web QA + Readiness Report v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- PR80 verifies the full PR61-PR79 Global Intent Interception Web phase as QA-only readiness evidence.
- Route inventory confirmed finite reports, stacks, collections, verticals, and alternatives routes only.
- Built sitemap inventory contains 33 URLs and no admin/API/MCP/payment or denied lifecycle-state paths.
- Checker matrix passed across policy, brand voice, public surface, sitemap notification, direct stack/collection/vertical/alternatives checkers, GitHub mirror dry-run, and full agent gate.
- No product code, app runtime, sitemap runtime, deploy, external search ping, Public API release, MCP release, payment behavior, dependency, screenshot, or `88cn-index-data` mutation occurred.

## Global Intent Web Evidence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| PR61-PR79 completion matrix exists | PASS |
| Route inventory exists | PASS |
| Built sitemap inventory exists | PASS |
| Scaled content abuse review exists | PASS |
| Public copy and forbidden-claim review exists | PASS |
| Data leakage review exists | PASS |
| IndexNow and Google Indexing API review exists | PASS |
| GitHub mirror dry-run review exists | PASS |

| Built sitemap has 33 URLs | PASS |
| Built sitemap excludes admin/API/MCP/payment and denied lifecycle state paths | PASS |
| Reverse alternatives slugs are absent | PASS |

## Screenshots

None. PR80 forbids `screenshots/**`, so QA used source inspection, command output, built sitemap output, local `/tmp` dry-run output, and repository state checks.

# PR98 B2B Feed Leakage QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Scope: PR98 B2B Feed Leakage QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- PR98 reviewed the closed PR81-PR97 B2B Alpha Feed boundary for leakage risk.
- Private founder/contact fields, admin/review notes, payment state, API
  credential material, raw database rows, private telemetry, internal scoring
  internals, and non-public lifecycle states remain denied by docs/contracts.
- Alpha Feed runtime remains static/disabled; no customer access, live feed,
  API credential runtime, metering runtime, Laravel runtime, Supabase write,
  external delivery, or data repository mutation was enabled.
- Existing lifecycle-scoped checker debt remains non-blocking: the PR95 landing
  checker does not account for the later PR96 disabled/no-write form shell, and
  the Laravel checker fixture mode is not suitable for the full current repo.

## Recommendation

PR98 can merge after required checks pass. After PR98 merge and cleanup, proceed
to PR99 as docs/ops-only pivot-gate work.

# PR99 Alpha Feed Monetization Pivot Gate v0

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Scope: PR99 Alpha Feed Monetization Pivot Gate v0
- Role: Codex-Build
- Result: PASS
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- PR99 defines Day30, Day60, and Day100 internal operating gates for B2B Alpha
  Feed viability.
- Continue, pause, pivot, and kill criteria are documented for each checkpoint.
- Safe metric-source rules require existing verified evidence only and forbid
  invented metrics, private details, live tracking, customer signup, payment,
  external services, Supabase writes, and runtime delivery.
- `ops/contracts/alpha-feed-pivot-gate.json` records the same gate in
  machine-readable form for PR100 and OPS8A consumption.

# PR131 Demand-Side Traffic QA v0

- Date: 2026-06-20
- Scope: PR131 Demand-Side Traffic QA v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PASS_WITH_FINDING
- Blocked: No

## Summary

- PR131 verifies the PR122-PR131 demand-side traffic chain as the final QA
  closer.
- Task discovery checker passes for the finite `/tasks/[slug]` route.
- Alternatives canonical checker passes with 4 published canonical routes.
- Report distribution pack dry-run passes with 4 source reports, 7 planned
  files, and all external-write safety flags false.
- Built sitemap output includes `/landscape`, exactly one task URL, 4 canonical
  alternatives URLs, and 4 report URLs.
- Built sitemap output does not include `/zh-CN`, `/landscape/sectors`, or the
  reverse alternatives route.
- Data repo remains clean.

| `npm run agent:gate` | PASS |

## Findings

- P0: none
- P1: none
- P2: none
- P3: `npm run landscape:check` is stale after PR123 because it still expects
  `app/tasks` and `/tasks` sitemap entries to be absent. The finite task route
  is intentionally owned by `scripts/check-task-discovery-boundary.mjs`.

## Recommendation

PR131 can merge after required checks pass. After PR131 merge and post-merge
revalidation, the PR122-PR131 demand-side traffic chain is closed.

# PR144 Scouted Sandbox No-Publish QA v0

# PR210 CONTENT50 Frontend Smoke v0

- Date: 2026-06-21
- Scope: PR210 CONTENT50 Frontend Smoke v0
- Role: Codex-QA
- Result: PR210_UNBLOCKED_PUBLISHED_PROJECTION_JSONL_BOUND
- Blocked: Browser smoke only, because local healthz is unavailable

## Summary

- PR209 generated 27 public-safe rows in
  `lib/projects/published-projection.jsonl`.
- `lib/projects/published-projection.ts` now loads the JSONL projection,
  normalizes `category` into the existing `primary_category` adapter shape, and
  returns only public fields for rows with `lifecycle_status = "published"`.
- `npm run build` passed and generated 27 `/projects/[slug]` routes from the
  PR209 projection.
- Static leakage scan passed for built public/client/project/sitemap artifacts:
  no seed filenames, staging queue filename, evidence fields, canonical fields,
  row hashes, review flags, rejected flags, private evidence IDs/hashes/notes,
  or canonical risk markers were found.
- Browser smoke was not opened because `scripts/codex-preflight.sh` failed:
  `http://localhost:3000/api/healthz` did not return 200.
- Frontend coverage is unblocked: generated project route overlap with PR209
  projection rows is 27 of 27.
- Sitemap dry-run includes 27 project URLs from the PR209 projection.
- Collections fail closed because the existing finite collection registry points
  to legacy fixture slugs not present in the PR209 projection; this does not
  expose non-published rows.

## Validation Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| JSONL row check | PASS: 27 rows, 27 published |
| `scripts/codex-preflight.sh` | BLOCKED: local healthz unavailable; no browser opened |
| `npm run verify:day0` | PASS |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:redact:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:batch:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:train-plan:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- PR210` | PASS |
| `npm run lint` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `npm run build` | PASS: generated 27 project routes |
| `npm run agent:gate` | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| static leakage scan | PASS |
| generated route coverage probe | PASS: 27/27 PR209 projection coverage |
| sitemap dry-run probe | PASS: 27 project URLs |

## Findings

- P0: none
- P1: none
- P2: browser validation is blocked until local preflight healthz returns 200.
- P3: existing finite collection slugs currently resolve to zero static
  collection pages because their registry members are legacy fixture slugs, not
  PR209 projection slugs. The behavior is fail-closed and does not leak private
  or non-published data.

## Recommendation

PR210 is unblocked for the published projection JSONL binding and is ready for
human review as a stacked PR after PR208 and PR209. Browser smoke remains blocked
only by unavailable local healthz. No deploy, server/cloud action, database
write, external API call, sitemap production push, worker/runtime/queue start,
raw seed/evidence/audit mutation or exposure, PR211/PR206/Growth work, or
companion index-data repo mutation occurred.
