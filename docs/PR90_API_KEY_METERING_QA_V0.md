# PR90 API Key + Metering QA v0

## Result

PASS_WITH_SIDECAR.

PR90 verifies the PR87, PR88, and PR89 API key plus metering boundary as a
closed QA-only train. No product code, runtime route, schema, package,
deployment, external service, or data repository mutation was added.

## Disabled Route Smoke Result

Local dev server only: `npm run dev -- -p 3100`.

| Method | Path | Status | Content-Type | Body Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/alpha-feed/api-keys` | 503 | `application/problem+json` | PASS: disabled Problem Details |
| POST | `/api/alpha-feed/api-keys` | 503 | `application/problem+json` | PASS: disabled Problem Details |

Both responses returned:

```json
{
  "type": "https://88cn.com/problems/api-keys-disabled",
  "title": "API key access is disabled",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Alpha Data Feed API key access is not enabled for this environment.",
  "instance": "/api/alpha-feed/api-keys"
}
```

Field-level response checks found no key material fields, no hash fields, no
secret fields, no bearer fields, no payment fields, no Stripe fields, and no
customer fields.

## Negative Probe Coverage Review

## Data Repo Cleanliness

`/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` remained clean on `main` tracking
`origin/main`. PR90 did not mutate it.

## Findings By Severity

- P0: none.
- P1: none.
- P2: none.
- P3: PR89 uses `bearer_credential`, `session_credential`, and `claim_credential` as denied field names instead of the external brief's credential-word literal because the repo-wide public wording scanner forbids that literal outside allowlisted policy files. This is equivalent for the boundary and already recorded in `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md`.

## Sidecar Issues

PR90 adds one P3 sidecar note for the PR89 denied-field naming equivalence and
does not bypass any failed gate or missing checkpoint.

## What This QA Does Not Do

PR90 does not modify product code, implement API key issuance, generate API
keys, implement metering runtime, create billing/payment logic, import Stripe,
add Supabase migrations, create Laravel runtime, configure Redis production,
mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`, deploy, or start PR91.

## Train Completion

`TRAIN-PR87-PR90-API-KEY-METERING-SHELL` is complete after PR90 merges and
post-merge cleanup succeeds.

## Next Train Readiness

`TRAIN-PR91-PR94-LARAVEL-GATEWAY-SYNC` dry-run passes with four planned tasks.
It remains high-risk and checkpointed. PR91 was not started.
