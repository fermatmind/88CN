## Known Limitations

- Direct local SSH remained unavailable during QA, so Aliyun Cloud Assistant was used as the stable execution channel.
- Supabase runtime/admin keys are not configured for the live app. Public pages, read-only demo API, security headers, submit/claim graceful fallback, and unauthenticated admin guards were verified.
- No real database write, admin approval, rejection, needs-info, or publish mutation was performed.
- Server IP, env values, keys, credentials, deploy URLs, and certificate material were not recorded.
