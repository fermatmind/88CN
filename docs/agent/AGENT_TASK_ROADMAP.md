## Execution Order

```text
AGENT0R
  -> AGENT1
  -> AGENT2
  -> AGENT3
  -> AGENT4
  -> AGENT5
  -> AGENT6
  -> AGENT7
  -> AGENT8
  -> AGENT9
  -> AGENTQ
  -> AGENT-INTEGRATION0
  -> BULK200_AGENT_DRY_RUN
  -> BULK1000_AGENT_DRY_RUN
```

`AGENT-INTEGRATION0` is the first task that may connect worker output back to the `88CN` admin review queue, and only after a separate explicit approval.
