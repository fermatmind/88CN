# OPS1 Agent OS QA

## Result

PASS

OPS1 core gates, roadmap checks, redaction checks, shell checks, dry-run deploy behavior, and contract checks passed. The original QA pass found one P1 scope configuration gap and one P3 stale metadata issue; both were remediated in this PR with narrow OPS task metadata changes.

## Current Main Commit

- PR #31 merge commit: `506ecd0`
- Branch under QA: `codex/agent-operating-system-qa`

## Files Existence Checklist

PASS. All required OPS1 files exist.

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ops/tasks/roadmap.json` | PASS | Present |
| `ops/tasks/current.json` | PASS | Present and points to OPS1Q complete |
| `ops/skills/*` | PASS | 9 required skill cards present |
| `ops/contracts/*` | PASS | 8 required contracts present |
| `scripts/agent/*` | PASS | 12 required agent scripts present |
| `docs/OPS1_AGENT_OPERATING_SYSTEM_V1.md` | PASS | Present |

## Roadmap JSON Check

PASS.

| Check | Result | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roadmap.json` parses | PASS | JSON parse succeeded |
| `current.json` parses | PASS | JSON parse succeeded |
| Required task ids present | PASS | OPS0, OPS1, OPS1Q, OPS2, OPS2Q, PR31, PR32, PR33, PR34, PR35 |
| PR31 title | PASS | `External Import Consumer Quarantine Summary v0` |
| PR31 role | PASS | `codex-build` |
| PR31 type | PASS | `product` |
| PR32 title | PASS | `Seed 100 Import Dry Run + Admin Staging QA` |
| PR32 role | PASS | `codex-qa` |
| OPS2 title | PASS | `Codex Tool & Plugin Registry v0` |

## Current JSON Check

PASS.

`ops/tasks/current.json` still contains:

```json
{
  "current_task": "OPS1Q",
  "current_repo": "88CN",
  "current_role": "codex-qa",
  "status": "complete"
}
```

This removes the stale OPS1 in-progress metadata observed in the first QA pass.

## Package Scripts Check

PASS. All required package scripts are present.

- `agent:gate`
- `agent:smoke:local`
- `agent:smoke:live`
- `agent:deploy:production`
- `agent:redact:check`
- `agent:scope:check`
- `agent:triage:check`
- `agent:cache-contract:check`
- `agent:telemetry-contract:check`
- `agent:event-contract:check`
- `agent:pr:summary`

## Gate Results

PASS.

| Command | Result |

## Agent Script Results

PASS.

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run agent:redact:check` | PASS | No high-risk values detected |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- OPS1` | PASS | OPS1 files are scoped |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- OPS1Q` before report write | PASS | Clean tree had no changes |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- OPS1Q` after remediation | PASS | `docs/OPS1_AGENT_OS_QA.md`, `docs/QA_REPORT.md`, and narrow OPS task metadata paths are allowed |
| `npm run agent:triage:check` | PASS | No triage files found |
| `npm run agent:cache-contract:check` | PASS | Contract parse and required fields pass |
| `npm run agent:telemetry-contract:check` | PASS | Contract parse and required fields pass |
| `npm run agent:event-contract:check` | PASS | Contract parse and required fields pass |
| `npm run agent:pr:summary` | PASS | Runs and reports changed files |

## Shell Script Safety Check

PASS.

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `bash -n scripts/agent/gate.sh` | PASS |
| `bash -n scripts/agent/smoke-local.sh` | PASS |
| `bash -n scripts/agent/smoke-live.sh` | PASS |
| `bash -n scripts/agent/deploy-production.sh` | PASS |
| `bash -n scripts/agent/post-merge-cleanup.sh` | PASS |

## Deploy Dry-Run Result

PASS.

`npm run agent:deploy:production` defaults to dry-run and prints:

```text
dry-run: would fetch, sync main, build production, and restart PM2
pass --confirm for real deployment
```

It did not deploy, did not require production environment values, did not print environment values, did not require a server address, and did not write server configuration.

## Redaction Negative Test Result

PASS.

Temporary worktree:

```text
/tmp/88cn-ops1q-redact-probe
```

Probe behavior:

- Created an untracked QA probe file containing a fake high-risk credential-shaped canary.
- Ran `node scripts/agent/redact-check.mjs`.
- Observed exit code `1`.
- Observed summary only: file path, line number, and rule name.
- Confirmed full fake canary was not printed.
- Removed the temporary worktree.

Observed output summary:

```text
redact-check failed with 1 finding(s)
- docs/OPS1Q_REDACT_PROBE.md:5 github_credential
```

## Scope Negative Test Result

PASS.

Temporary worktree:

```text
/tmp/88cn-ops1q-scope-probe
```

Probe behavior:

- Created untracked `app/OPS1Q_FORBIDDEN_PROBE.txt`.
- Ran `node scripts/agent/scope-check.mjs OPS1Q`.
- Observed exit code `1`.
- Removed the temporary worktree.

Observed output summary:

```text
scope-check failed for OPS1Q
- app/OPS1Q_FORBIDDEN_PROBE.txt allowed=false forbidden=true
```

## Contract Boundary Review

PASS.

| Contract | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `featured-signals-boundary.json` | PASS | Human-visible only; forbids sitemap, public API, MCP payload, signal score, and source confidence surfaces |
| `telemetry.json` | PASS | Opt-in default; CI default false; blocks secrets, environment values, and logs |
| `event-outbox.json` | PASS | Supabase source of truth; outbox and replay are required; full-table cron sync is forbidden |
| `cache-tags.json` | PASS | Bounded tag matrix exists; root revalidation wording is blocked |
| `public-api-boundary.json` | PASS | Published-only; blocks submitted, pending, quarantined, founder email, admin notes, and payment data |
| `mcp-boundary.json` | PASS | MCP reads Public API only and has no direct Supabase access |

## Sensitive Information Scan

PASS_WITH_NOTES.

`npm run agent:redact:check` passed.

Additional grep checks found only existing documentation references to environment variable names and placeholder examples:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- placeholder `eyJ...`

No real secret values were detected by `agent:redact:check`.

## Findings

| Severity | Area | Finding | Impact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | OPS1Q scope config | `OPS1Q.allowed_paths` did not include `docs/OPS1_AGENT_OS_QA.md`, which this QA task is explicitly allowed to write. | Final `agent:scope:check -- OPS1Q` failed after the required report was created. | Remediated in this PR by adding the QA report path and exact OPS task metadata files. |
| P3 | Current task metadata | `ops/tasks/current.json` still said OPS1 was in progress. | Non-blocking when commands pass an explicit task id. | Remediated in this PR by setting OPS1Q complete metadata. |

## OPS2 Readiness

OPS2 can proceed after this PR merges. The P1 scope path gap and stale current metadata finding are remediated in this PR, and final OPS1Q scope validation passes.
