# 10 Data Contract

88CN expects a future split between the main web repository and a public index-data repository.

## Public JSON Scope

Public JSON may contain only public project metadata:

- project name
- official website
- category slug
- one-line description
- public GitHub URL
- public docs URL
- public pricing URL

## Excluded Data

Public repositories must not collect contact addresses, private revenue proof, payment screenshots, keys, analytics exports, bank records, identity documents, customer lists, or login credentials.

## Import Boundary

## Unknown Values

When a value is unavailable, use:

- Not verified
