## Main Repo Commit

`443e401439dc0cf332644324ea921b39b013aec1`

PR #51 / OPS-4B is merged into `origin/main`, and local `main` matched `origin/main` before OPS4BQ started.

## Scope Confirmation

OPS4BQ is registered in `ops/tasks/roadmap.json` with:

- role: `codex-qa`
- type: `qa`
- repo: `88CN`
- deployment: `none`
- allowed paths limited to QA docs, task status, sidecar/build reports, and `ops/tasks/current.json`
- forbidden paths blocking product code, scripts, package files, roadmap edits, train registry edits, deployment code, public assets, secrets, and data repo writes

OPS4BQ updated only allowed paths.

## Definition Of Done Checklist

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| OPS4B scripts and package gates are verified from QA scope | PASS |
| Negative and positive QA evidence is recorded | PASS |
| QA does not modify scripts, package files, product code, or deployment configuration | PASS |

## TRAIN-PR42-PR46 Readiness

TRAIN-PR42-PR46 is unblocked for batch planning and dry-run preflight.

Before implementation, each PR42-PR46 task still needs a full roadmap task object because the current roadmap skeleton rule says to register a full task object before implementation.

## What This QA Does Not Do

- Does not modify product code.
- Does not modify scripts or package files.
- Does not modify the batch registry or roadmap.
- Does not deploy.
- Does not start PR42 or any future product train.
- Does not connect to Supabase production.
- Does not connect to Stripe.
- Does not configure MCP.
- Does not modify `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`.
