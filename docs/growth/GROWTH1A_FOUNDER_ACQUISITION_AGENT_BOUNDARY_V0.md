# GROWTH1A Founder Acquisition Agent Boundary v0

Date: 2026-06-20
Role: Codex-Research
Result: GO_GROWTH1B
Next task: GROWTH1B Founder Lead Queue + Outreach Draft Generator v0

## Scope

GROWTH1A defines the safe boundary for a founder acquisition assistant before
any local lead-queue or outreach-draft work. This is boundary and handoff
documentation only. It does not collect contact data, create a lead database,
send messages, post externally, log in to platforms, create GitHub Issues or
comments, write CRM records, store PII, connect analytics, write Supabase,
mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`, or deploy.

The current GROWTH1B roadmap scope is docs/status/roadmap only. GROWTH1B must
not add executable generator code, scripts, app/runtime files, package metadata,
committed generated output, data-repo files, or outreach automation unless a
later roadmap task explicitly changes that scope.

## Safe Inputs

Future local-only founder acquisition draft work may reference only reviewed,
public, non-contact project signals already present in the 88CN repo:

- public project name;
- 88CN public project path;
- public report path;
- category, stack, vertical, collection, task, or alternatives route context;
- public project one-line description already reviewed in 88CN;
- public project official site URL when already present in reviewed local data;
- published report title, slug, kind, and date;
- public-signal readiness notes already approved in 88CN docs.

Every input must be treated as editorial context for a human reviewer, not as a
permission to contact a founder.

## Unsafe Inputs

The assistant must not collect, infer, enrich, store, or import:

- emails, phone numbers, personal handles, DMs, or account IDs;
- CRM fields, customer lists, contact exports, newsletter lists, private
  community member lists, or paid-tool lead exports;
- private founder identity documents or verification material;
- private revenue, billing, payment, analytics, or server-log material;
- browser cookies, sessions, local profile exports, or logged-in platform data;
- unreviewed crawl output or scraped profile content;
- private data from `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- any field that would make a generated artifact a contact database.

Unknown data must remain absent or use neutral wording such as `not reviewed`.

## Allowed Local-Only Artifacts

Within the current docs-only roadmap scope, GROWTH1B may document a future
artifact contract for:

- finite project review queue grouped by public 88CN route context;
- public project summary card template;
- outreach draft template for human review;
- manual review checklist;
- redaction checklist;
- no-send safety manifest;
- reviewer notes explaining what a human must verify before any external use.

No output should be committed as a generated lead list. A future executable
generator, if separately approved, must write only to `/tmp` or another ignored
local path by default.

## Draft Copy Rules

Local drafts must:

- describe 88CN as a public AI project discovery and growth-signal surface;
- cite only public 88CN routes or reviewed public project facts;
- avoid private contact fields and personal account targeting;
- avoid invented traffic, adoption, ranking, funding, endorsement, customer, or
  search-visibility claims;
- avoid platform-specific send instructions;
- make human review mandatory before any external use;
- keep the decision to contact, edit, discard, or publish outside Codex.

## Hard Prohibitions

The founder acquisition assistant must not:

- send outreach;
- send email;
- send DMs;
- post externally;
- create GitHub Issues or comments;
- log in to GitHub, X, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, email, CRM, newsletter, or any
  other platform;
- read browser cookies or export browser sessions;
- scrape or enrich contact data;
- store PII;
- create a committed lead database;
- call social, email, CRM, or platform APIs;
- connect live analytics;
- write Supabase;
- mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- deploy.

## GROWTH1B Handoff

GROWTH1B may proceed only as a local-only draft/queue contract task within its
roadmap allowed paths. It should produce a reviewable no-send packet spec with
safety flags that remain false for:

- external writes;
- email sends;
- DM sends;
- social posts;
- platform login;
- CRM writes;
- PII inclusion;
- browser session export;
- contact enrichment;
- data repo mutation;
- deploy.

If the team later wants executable queue generation, that requires a separate
scope change before implementation. GROWTH1B must not infer permission to edit
`scripts/**`, `app/**`, `lib/**`, package files, public assets, or the data
repo from this boundary.

## Validation Evidence

GROWTH1A must pass:

- `npm run verify:day0`
- `npm run policy:scan`
- `npm run third-party:check`
- `npm run agent:redact:check`
- `npm run agent:scope:check -- GROWTH1A`
- `npm run agent:batch:check`
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run agent:gate`
- direct landscape, sector-density, task-discovery, alternatives, and report
  distribution dry-run checks
