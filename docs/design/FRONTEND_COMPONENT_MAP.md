## SiteHeader

Purpose:

- provide stable public navigation without exposing admin/raw surfaces;
- prioritize Projects, Collections, Methodology, and Submit after the design architecture is implemented;
- keep brand visible but not oversized.

Inputs:

- static public nav items;
- optional search entry point state;
- no project data required.

Layout:

- sticky top header, 48-56px height;
- left brand mark/text;
- center or right compact nav;
- optional search icon or small search input on desktop;
- mobile menu or horizontal scroll with no clipping.

Rules:

- do not link to `/admin` in public header;
- do not link to raw reports or internal scout/admin paths;
- avoid marketing copy in the header;
- keep touch targets at least 40px high on mobile.

## SiteFooter

Purpose:

- provide utility navigation and policy links;
- reinforce public data boundary without long explanatory copy.

Inputs:

- static links: Projects, Collections, Methodology, Submit, optional Reports if public-safe;
- no raw data.

Layout:

- compact neutral footer;
- two rows on mobile, single row on desktop;
- optional small copyright line.

Rules:

- no admin link;
- no raw pipeline link;
- no claims about visibility outcomes;
- footer should not become a keyword dump.

## HeroSearch

Purpose:

- make search the primary first-viewport action;
- route users into `/projects` without creating crawlable query landing pages.

Inputs:

- default query string;
- finite shortcut links to base routes or finite collections;
- optional count from published projections only.

Layout:

- prominent search input with submit button;
- small shortcut chips below;
- avoid oversized marketing text after launch.

Behavior:

- submit navigates to `/projects?q=...`;
- query pages are noindex/follow by metadata;
- empty query navigates to `/projects`.

No-leak checks:

- placeholder and suggestions cannot include unpublished names;
- counts must derive from published projections only.

## ProjectCard

Purpose:

- optimize scanning across listing, home, and collections;
- expose only reviewed public data.

Inputs:

- `PublishedProjectProjection`.

Visible fields:

- project name;
- original summary;
- category;
- model type;
- public signal chips;
- official hostname;
- last reviewed;
- optional collection labels when space allows.

Forbidden fields:

- raw evidence;
- raw audit;
- internal confidence;
- review notes;
- private hashes;
- rejected/quarantine detail;
- unverified metrics.

Layout:

- 8px card radius or less;
- title one line with optional external/detail affordance;

- official link row at bottom;
- review timestamp visible on expanded card or listing detail mode.

Mobile:

- one column;
- summary remains two to three lines;

Inputs:

- array of published projections;
- pagination state;
- optional result count.

Layout:

- desktop 3 columns where width allows;
- tablet 2 columns;
- mobile 1 column;
- fixed gaps and no masonry layout.

Behavior:

- supports deterministic pagination;
- does not virtualize in v0 unless later needed;

## ProjectSignalChips

Purpose:

- show reviewed source and readiness signals in a compact, machine-readable visual form.

Inputs:

- `public_signal_chips`;
- optional display mode: compact, detail, card.

Display rules:

- map known chip keys to reader-friendly labels;
- unknown chip keys should either be hidden or rendered only if allowlisted by public projection policy;
- do not invent positive chips from missing data;
- do not show internal weights.

Visual:

- neutral outline/fill chips;
- small icon only when it clarifies source type;
- no success-heavy color treatment that implies endorsement.

## ProjectOfficialLinks

Inputs:

- `PublishedProjectProjection`.

Visible fields:

- project name;
- summary;
- category;
- model type;
- published projection label;
- review timestamp;
- official link.

Layout:

## Component QA Matrix

| Check | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Accepts only public projection or static policy input | ProjectCard, ProjectGrid, ProjectSignalChips, ProjectOfficialLinks, ProjectDetailHero, ReviewTimestamp. |
| Query variants noindex | HeroSearch, SearchFilterPanel, NoIndexGuard. |
| No admin/raw links | SiteHeader, SiteFooter, EmptyState. |
| No unreviewed collection exposure | CollectionCard, CollectionGrid. |
| No internal confidence or hash rendering | all project components. |
| Mobile no-overlap | SiteHeader, HeroSearch, ProjectCard, SearchFilterPanel, ProjectDetailHero. |
| Official links clear | ProjectOfficialLinks, ProjectCard, ProjectDetailHero. |
| Empty states non-leaky | EmptyState, ProjectGrid, CollectionGrid, NoIndexGuard. |

## Future Implementation Notes

Future implementation should proceed as narrow PRs:

- keep all component inputs typed to public projection or static public policy;
- add tests or checkers around public rendering if a component touches project data;
- avoid adding new dependencies for v0 design polish;
- avoid changing sitemap helpers in visual-only PRs;
- keep admin and public component namespaces separate;
- run policy, redaction, train, type, build, and gate checks before PR handoff.
