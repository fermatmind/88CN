# PR77 GitHub Profile Mirror QA

## Scope

PR77 is QA-only for the PR75 mirror spec and PR76 local-only generator.

No app, component, library, script, schema, route, sitemap, dependency, deployment, Public API, MCP, payment, external index ping, screenshot, generated mirror output, external repository, or data repository file was modified.

## QA Result

PASS.

## Evidence

| Area | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR75 spec exists | `docs/PR75_GITHUB_STRUCTURED_PROFILE_MIRROR_SPEC_V0.md` defines reviewed-public source boundary, markdown contract, and PR76 local-only requirements. | PASS |
| PR76 generator exists | `scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs` exists on `main` after PR76 merge. | PASS |
| Local-only dry-run works | `node scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs --dry-run --source local --out /tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77 --no-write-external` generated 6 markdown files under `/tmp`. | PASS |
| Output reports no external write | Generator JSON reported `externalWrite: false`. | PASS |
| Output reports no data repo mutation | Generator JSON reported `dataRepoMutation: false`. | PASS |
| Repo output path blocked | Generator rejected `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88CN/generated/github-profile-mirror` with non-zero exit. | PASS |
| Remote source blocked | Generator rejected `--source remote` with non-zero exit. | PASS |
| Generated output not committed | `git ls-files generated/github-profile-mirror` returned no files, and `find generated/github-profile-mirror` returned no committed or working-tree files. | PASS |
| Data repo clean | `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` reported `## main...origin/main` with no dirty files. | PASS |
| Worktree clean after dry-run | The 88CN worktree had no dirty files before PR77 documentation edits. | PASS |

## Output Privacy Review

QA inspected `/tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77` output.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Generated file count is 6 | PASS |
| No email address pattern was found | PASS |
| No `sourceConfidence` field was found | PASS |
| No `signalScore` field was found | PASS |
| No `externalWrite` or `dataRepoMutation` runtime fields were embedded in generated markdown | PASS |
| No forbidden search-promising, guaranteed outcome, investment, external indexing, Public API, MCP, GitHub Pages, or external PR language was found | PASS |
| Boundary text explicitly excludes private founder, payment, admin, analytics, and review metadata | PASS |

The grep hits for `admin`, `payment`, and `analytics` were the expected boundary disclaimer text. The grep hits for `pulse-analytics` were the public project name, project slug, public official URL, public GitHub URL, and public docs URL.

## Sample Output Review

Reviewed sample output files:

- `/tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77/aurora-code.md`
- `/tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77/scribe-ai.md`

Both samples contained only:

- project name;
- reviewed public tagline;
- 88CN public profile placeholder URL;
- public official site;
- public GitHub URL;
- docs URL or approved unknown label;
- category;
- public lifecycle state;
- public-signal labels instead of raw score values;
- approved unknown label for non-reviewed editorial note;
- explicit boundary disclaimers.

## Validation Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `node scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs --dry-run --source local --out /tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77 --no-write-external` | PASS |
| `node scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs --dry-run --source local --out /Users/rainie/Desktop/88CN/generated/github-profile-mirror --no-write-external` | PASS, rejected with non-zero exit |
| `node scripts/generate-github-profile-mirror.mjs --dry-run --source remote --out /tmp/88cn-github-profile-mirror-pr77 --no-write-external` | PASS, rejected with non-zero exit |
| `npm run agent:scope:check -- PR77` | PASS |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run verify:day0` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run lint` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `npm run build` | PASS |

## Screenshots

None. PR77 roadmap allowed paths exclude `screenshots/**`, so QA used source inspection, generator output inspection, command output, and repository state checks only.

## Findings

- P0: none
- P1: none
- P2: none
- P3: none

## Recommendation

PR77 can merge after full gate passes. Do not start PR78 from this train.
