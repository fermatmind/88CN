# PR211 CONTENT27 Deploy Gate Refresh v0

## Result

`READY_FOR_CONTENT27_DEPLOY_APPROVAL`

PR211 refreshes the non-deploy production approval gate after PR208, PR209,
and PR210 merged. It does not deploy.

## Scope

- Repo: `88CN`
- Task: `PR211 / CONTENT27_DEPLOY_GATE_REFRESH`
- Purpose: refresh the deploy gate for the 27 published projection rows now
  present on current `main`.
- Deployment: `NO`
- SSH/server/cloud action: `NONE`
- Supabase/staging/production write: `NONE`
- Data repo mutation: `NONE`
- Worker/runtime/crawler/Redis/queue action: `NONE`

## Current Main SHA

`ed4fbecc6de357701d0a54d9aa9b3b5f9a190e79`

## Previous Stale PR205 Candidate SHA

`4f5792564d78966556189f18e40c97cff2b9ad23`

The PR205 candidate is stale because PR208, PR209, and PR210 merged after
PR205.

## New Content27 Deploy Candidate SHA

`ed4fbecc6de357701d0a54d9aa9b3b5f9a190e79`

This is the current `main` SHA after PR208, PR209, and PR210.

## Merge Confirmation

| PR | Result | Merge commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR208 | merged into `main` | `3e547db2013979d1bc8f5226a321af5d870d9ea7` |

| PR210 | merged into `main` | `ed4fbecc6de357701d0a54d9aa9b3b5f9a190e79` |

All three merge commits were verified as ancestors of current `HEAD`.

## Published Projection Verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Published projection file | `lib/projects/published-projection.jsonl` exists |
| JSONL rows | `27` |
| Published rows | `27` |
| Missing slug | `0` |
| Missing summary | `0` |
| Missing official URL | `0` |
| First published slug | `langchain` |

## Route / Sitemap / Search Dry Run

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Project route candidates | `27` |
| Sitemap project URL candidates | `27` |
| Search index source rows | `27` |
| Loader binding | `lib/projects/published-projection.ts` reads `lib/projects/published-projection.jsonl` |
| Sitemap binding | `app/sitemap.ts` uses `getProjectSitemapEntries` |
| Search binding | `lib/projects/search-index.ts` uses `getPublishedProjectProjections` |

## Leakage Scan

Result: `PASS`

The public projection loader returns an allowlisted public shape and fails
closed when forbidden private fields are present. Grep matches for private-field
terms were limited to admin/internal import and bulk-review surfaces, plus
compiled admin bundles/cache under `.next`. No public project route, sitemap
entry, search index serializer, or public projection output was identified as
exposing seed, evidence, audit, review, quarantine, rejected, hash, or internal
confidence fields.

## Validation Results

Baseline validation before PR211 edits:

- `npm run verify:day0`: pass
- `npm run policy:scan`: pass
- `npm run third-party:check`: pass
- `npm run agent:redact:check`: pass
- `npm run agent:batch:check`: pass
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`: pass
- `npm run lint`: pass
- `npm run typecheck`: pass
- `npm run build`: pass
- `npm run agent:gate`: pass
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`: blocked on stale current
  status before PR211 metadata refresh

PR211 refresh fixes the stale current-task status by using the known lifecycle
state `validation_passed`.

Final PR211 validation after the metadata refresh:

- `npm run agent:scope:check -- PR211`: pass
- `npm run agent:redact:check`: pass
- `npm run agent:batch:check`: pass
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check`: pass
- `npm run verify:day0`: pass
- `npm run policy:scan`: pass
- `npm run third-party:check`: pass
- `npm run lint`: pass
- `npm run typecheck`: pass
- `npm run build`: pass
- `npm run agent:gate`: pass
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs`: pass
- `npm run landscape:check`: pass
- `node scripts/check-sector-density-boundary.mjs`: pass
- `node scripts/check-task-discovery-boundary.mjs`: pass
- `node scripts/check-alternatives-canonical.mjs`: pass
- `git diff --check`: pass
