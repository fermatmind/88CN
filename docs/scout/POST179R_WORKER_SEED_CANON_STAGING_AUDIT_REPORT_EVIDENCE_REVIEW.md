# POST179R Worker / Seed / Canon / Staging / Audit / Report Data Evidence Review

Status: validation passed
Task: PR180 / POST179R
Result: GO_SEED_HANDOFF0
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR180 reviewed PR160-PR179 repository evidence and local artifacts.

Decision: `GO_SEED_HANDOFF0`.

The next real task should harden the Seed 40 local identity hints into a durable, schema-validated, timestamped, hashable local/private handoff artifact before any real external audit proof, report proof, or Growth work.

## Scope

This is a post-train evidence review and next-step gate. It reviews only existing repository reports, task metadata, GitHub merge evidence, and local `/tmp` artifacts.

No implementation, external HTTP audit, staging write, Supabase write, Redis/queue creation, worker/crawler runtime, public report page, sitemap entry, Public API/MCP exposure, data repo mutation, deployment, server/cloud mutation, or FermatMind repo mutation occurred.

## Artifact Inventory

Durable repository artifacts are policy, decision, and QA reports under `docs/infra/**`, `docs/scout/**`, `docs/TASK_STATUS.md`, and ops metadata. They are durable as review records, not as executable pipeline artifacts.

Local-only artifacts remain under `/tmp`:

- Seed identity hint pack: 40 accepted rows, 12 rejected/weak rows, manifest present.
- Canonical resolver output: 40 provisional canonical candidates, manifest present.
- Staging dry-run manifest: 5 sample would-write rows from 40 source rows.
- Audit dry-run manifest: 20 fixture rows from 40 source rows.

No official Seed 100 dataset, canonical dataset, staging table, audit result dataset, or report dataset exists in the repo or data repo.

## Artifact Durability Classification

Scale:

- L0 = policy/docs only
- L1 = local fixture or local dry-run summary
- L2 = durable local artifact with schema/hash/timestamp, still not public
- L3 = staging-backed record
- L4 = public reviewed artifact

Classification:

| Area | Level | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker | L0 | Docs and QA only; no repo, package, runtime, queue, or worker process. |
| Seed | L1 | `/tmp` local pack exists with schema and generated date, but no hash/checksum and no durable repo/data-repo handoff. |
| Canon | L1 | `/tmp` resolver output exists, but rows lack source URL, timestamp, and hash/checksum; no durable handoff. |
| Staging | L1 | `/tmp` manifest has 5 would-write samples; no staging schema, migration, or DB record. |
| Audit | L1 | Fixture-only `/tmp` manifest has 20 selected rows; no real HTTP results. |
| Report | L0 | English/Chinese/report QA docs are draft-only and aggregate-only; no dataset. |

No artifact reached L2, L3, or L4.

## Worker Outcome Review

PR160-PR162 created only docs, boundary decisions, chain registration, no-runtime bootstrap planning, and isolation QA.

Findings:

- Worker repo/package created: no.
- Dependency added: no.
- Worker runtime created: no.
- Crawler or queue created: no.
- Boundary reusable: yes, as policy and future architecture input.
- Next worker architecture step: wait until Seed handoff is durable, then define controlled audit proof or worker implementation checkpoint separately.

## Seed Outcome Review

A Seed pack exists only under `/tmp`.

Findings:

- Accepted candidate rows: 40.
- Rejected/weak rows: 12.
- Accepted confidence split: 21 strong, 19 medium.
- Rejected/weak reasons: 9 directory-only, 1 copied-copy risk, 1 no official site, 1 PII risk.
- Schema: manifest documents allowed accepted fields and local state fields.
- Timestamp: manifest has `generated_at=2026-06-20`; accepted rows have `discovered_at`.
- `source_url` for every accepted row: yes.
- Hash/checksum: no row or manifest hash/checksum found.
- Repo/data repo durability: no; generated files are `/tmp` only and uncommitted.

Seed is not durable enough for a controlled audit proof handoff. It requires a PR181 hardening task that preserves local/private status while adding schema validation, timestamping, hashability, manifest integrity, and handoff rules.

## Canonical Resolver Outcome Review

Canonical output exists only as a `/tmp` dry-run output.

Findings:

- Rows: 40 provisional canonical candidates.
- Duplicate candidates: 0.
- Ambiguity states: 0.
- Quarantine states: 0.
- Reproducibility: partially documented by PR166 rules and PR167 manifest, but no repo script/output, no row hash, and no durable handoff file.
- Audit input readiness: insufficient for real audit proof until Seed and canonical handoff artifacts are made durable and integrity-checkable.

## Staging Outcome Review

No staging write occurred.

Findings:

- Would-write sample count: 5.
- Source row count: 40.
- Reusable as dry-run shape evidence: yes.
- Reusable as staging data: no.
- Staging schema/migration: none.
- Migration checkpoint still required: yes, before any real staging write.

## Audit Outcome Review

No external HTTP audit occurred.

Findings:

- Audit rows are fixture-only.
- Fixture count: 20.
- External HTTP attempted: false.
- Browser attempted: false.
- Worker started: false.
- Queue/Redis used: false.
- Actual official-source results: none.
- Enough data for data-backed report: no.

Before real audit proof, PR181 should first make Seed handoff durable. After that, a later audit-proof task can define controlled official-source HTTP audit boundaries.

## Report Outcome Review

REPORT_DATA1 and REPORT_DATA2 are draft-only, not data-backed project reports.

Findings:

- Public report dataset: none.
- Public page: none.
- Sitemap entry: none.
- Public JSON/report registry: none.
- Public API/MCP exposure: none.
- Supported narrative: aggregate/process readiness only.
- Enough for Growth: no.

## Gap Analysis

Main gaps:

1. Seed and canonical outputs are still `/tmp` local artifacts.
2. No hash/checksum or manifest integrity chain exists for Seed or canonical outputs.
3. No durable local handoff convention exists.
4. No staging schema or migration exists.
5. No real external HTTP audit rows exist.
6. No public or private report dataset exists.
7. No evidence supports Growth, public distribution, or project-level claims.

## Decision Gate Analysis

Rejected options:

- `GO_AUDIT_PROOF0_WITH_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS`: rejected because Seed/canonical artifacts are local-only `/tmp` outputs without hash/checksum or durable handoff.
- `GO_REPORT_PROOF0`: rejected because no real external audit rows or report dataset exist.
- `GO_GROWTH2R`: rejected because there is no data-backed report material.
- `BLOCKED_MISSING_ARTIFACTS`: rejected because the required PR160-PR179 docs and local evidence are present enough for a next-step decision.

Selected option:

`GO_SEED_HANDOFF0`.

## Exact Next Recommended Task

Register but do not start:

PR181 / SEED_HANDOFF0 - Seed 40/50 Durable Local Artifact Handoff Boundary v0

Purpose:

Make Seed identity hints durable, schema-validated, timestamped, hashable, still local/private/no-public.

Expected boundary:

- no public page;
- no sitemap;
- no Public API/MCP;
- no data repo mutation unless a later explicit task authorizes it;
- no Supabase/staging/production write;
- no external HTTP audit;
- no worker/crawler/queue;
- no deploy or server/cloud mutation;
- no Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101.

## Sidecar Findings

No sidecar-blocking issue was found.

Operational finding:

- PR164/PR167/PR171/PR174 local artifacts are present under `/tmp` in this environment, but `/tmp` is not a durable handoff plane. PR181 should avoid relying on long-lived `/tmp` availability as the only artifact source.
