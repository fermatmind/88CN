# REPORT_DATA0 Real Report Data Eligibility Scan

Status: validation passed
Task: PR176 / REPORT_DATA0
Result: GO_REPORT_DATA1_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR176 scans whether the reviewed worker, staging, and audit artifacts are eligible for real report data use.

Result: `GO_REPORT_DATA1_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

The current material is eligible only for an aggregate draft about pipeline readiness, boundaries, sample sizes, and limitations. It is not eligible for project-level readiness outcomes, public report pages, sitemap entries, public JSON, Public API, MCP, data repo exports, external distribution, or production/public claims.

## Checkpoint

PR176 has `human_checkpoint=true`.

The user said `继续执行剩余未完成的pr任务`, so PR176 proceeds only as a report-data eligibility decision. This checkpoint resolution does not authorize:

- public report page creation;
- sitemap inclusion;
- public JSON or report registry entries;
- Public API or MCP exposure;
- data repo export or mutation;
- external distribution, search submission, social, email, DM, CRM, or outreach write;
- production, staging, or Supabase write;
- deploy or server/cloud mutation;
- project-level publication, ranking, benchmark, score, recommendation, or negative project claim.

## Reviewed Inputs

Reviewed local and committed inputs:

- `docs/scout/SCOUT_STAGING2_STAGING_SANDBOX_WRITE_DRY_RUN.md`
- `docs/scout/SCOUT_STAGINGQ_STAGING_SANDBOX_NO_PUBLISH_QA.md`
- `docs/scout/AUDIT_WORKER0_HTTP_FIRST_AUDIT_WORKER_BOUNDARY_CAPACITY_MODEL.md`

- `/tmp/88cn-pr171-staging-sandbox-local-write-dry-run.json`
- `/tmp/88cn-pr174-small-batch-audit-fixture-dry-run.json`

The `/tmp` artifacts remain uncommitted local evidence only.

## Artifact Summary

| Artifact | Result | Report eligibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR171 staging local dry-run | `PASS_SCOUT_STAGING_LOCAL_DRY_RUN` | Eligible for aggregate pipeline-readiness context only. |
| PR172 no-publish QA | `PASS_SCOUT_STAGING_NO_PUBLISH_QA` | Eligible for safety/no-public-surface evidence. |
| PR173 audit worker boundary | `GO_AUDIT_WORKER1_WITH_CONDITIONAL_CAPACITY` | Eligible for methodology and capacity-limit context. |
| PR174 fixture audit dry-run | `PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_FIXTURE_DRY_RUN` | Eligible for local fixture-count and no-runtime evidence only. |
| PR175 audit worker QA | `PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_RUNTIME_QA` | Eligible for safety/no-runtime evidence. |

## Eligible Data Classes

The following may be used by PR177 as aggregate draft evidence:

| Data class | Eligible use | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Train completion statuses | Pipeline readiness summary | Must not imply project readiness outcomes. |
| PR171 source row count `40` | Sample-size context | Not a reviewed public dataset. |
| PR171 sample count `5` | Dry-run payload-shape context | Not report-eligible project observations. |
| PR174 source row count `40` | Input universe context | Source is local canonical dry-run only. |
| PR174 fixture count `20` | Small-batch fixture size context | No external HTTP audit occurred. |
| No-write/no-public flags | Safety and governance evidence | Can be aggregate only. |
| Capacity limits | Methodology constraints | Not runtime performance data. |
| TTL/correction expectations | Future report-methodology requirement | No current project observations to correct. |

## Ineligible Data Classes

The following are not eligible for report claims:

- project-level readiness pass/fail;
- project-level audit findings;
- rankings, scores, benchmarks, recommendations, or comparisons;
- live website availability claims;
- SEO, GEO, traffic, growth, revenue, users, retention, financing, backer interest, or founder verification claims;
- public project records created from local fixture rows;
- copied competitor or directory descriptions;
- raw HTML, screenshots, cookies, sessions, tokens, credentials, private analytics, customer data, payment data, or PII;
- any claim derived from external HTTP audit, because no external HTTP audit occurred;
- any claim that the PR174 fixture rows are audited, reviewed public records, or report-ready project data.

## PR174 Manifest Evidence

Local manifest:

```text
/tmp/88cn-pr174-small-batch-audit-fixture-dry-run.json
```

Observed fields:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `result` | `PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_FIXTURE_DRY_RUN` |
| `source_row_count` | `40` |
| `fixture_count` | `20` |
| `external_http_attempted` | `false` |
| `browser_attempted` | `false` |
| `worker_started` | `false` |
| `queue_created` | `false` |
| `data_repo_mutation` | `false` |
| `public_surface` | `false` |
| `report_surface` | `false` |

This supports only a draft claim that the report-data train has local fixture evidence and no-runtime safety evidence. It does not support project-level readiness conclusions.

## PR177 Handoff

PR177 / REPORT_DATA1 may create an English aggregate draft decision only if it stays within:

- aggregate pipeline-readiness evidence;
- sample-size and fixture-mode limitations;
- no-runtime/no-public-surface safety posture;
- methodology and eligibility boundaries;
- TTL/correction policy for future real observations;
- explicit statement that no project-level audit outcome exists.

PR177 must not create:

- public report page;
- sitemap entry;
- public JSON;
- report registry entry;
- Public API or MCP surface;
- data repo export;
- external distribution;
- project-level readiness table;
- rankings, scores, comparisons, recommendations, or negative project claims.

PR177 has `human_checkpoint=true` and is not started here.
