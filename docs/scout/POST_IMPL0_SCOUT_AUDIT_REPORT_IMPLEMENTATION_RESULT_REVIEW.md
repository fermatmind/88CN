# POST_IMPL0 Scout / Audit / Report Implementation Result Review + Next-Step Gate v0

Status: validation passed
Task: PR158 / POST_IMPL0
Result: GO_ARCH0_BEFORE_SECOND_GROWTH
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR158 reviews the completed PR146-PR157 SCOUT_IMPL, AUDIT_IMPL, and REPORT_IMPL implementation-stage train.

Result: `GO_ARCH0_BEFORE_SECOND_GROWTH`.

The train completed safely and all reviewed PRs are merged, but the outputs remain local-only, fixture-only, and draft-only. They do not provide a real staging dataset, real external audit results, public report data, or distribution-ready report material. The correct next lane is architecture and worker/staging readiness before any second-round Growth or public report distribution work.

## Scope

This is a post-train review and decision-gate task.

Allowed scope:

- verify PR146-PR157 completion state;
- review SCOUT_IMPL, AUDIT_IMPL, and REPORT_IMPL outcomes;
- decide Growth vs architecture vs report-publication checkpoint;
- register the immediate next recommended task only;
- update docs/status/roadmap metadata.

Forbidden scope:

- no implementation;
- no PR159 start;
- no Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 start;
- no deploy, SSH, server/cloud mutation, Supabase migration, Supabase write, staging write, production write, Redis/queue creation, worker runtime, crawler runtime, external HTTP audit, public report page, sitemap inclusion, Public API/MCP release, data repo mutation, FermatMind repo mutation, runtime/product code change, or secret access.

Completion answers:

1. PR146-PR157 are all merged.
2. Task branches are cleaned; no PR146-PR157 remote branch remains.
3. `main == origin/main` at preflight.
4. `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` is clean at preflight.
5. Baseline validation gates pass.
6. No P0/P1/P2 blocker was found for this post-train review.

## SCOUT_IMPL Outcome Review

PR146 decided the repo split posture: boundary, contract, and local dry-run work can remain in the 88CN control repo for now. A future `88cn-scout-worker` package or repo is only a later checkpointed worker/runtime decision.

SCOUT_IMPL findings:

- no new repo was created;
- no package or dependency was added;
- no Supabase migration was created;
- no staging DB write was performed;
- no production write was performed;
- no Redis/queue, worker, crawler, public page, sitemap, Public API, MCP, data repo mutation, or FermatMind repo mutation occurred;
- PR149 records only a local/docs/tmp-artifact posture and does not execute or commit generated output;
- PR150 verifies no public leakage across PR146-PR149.

SCOUT_IMPL therefore proves boundary readiness, not durable ingestion readiness.

## AUDIT_IMPL Outcome Review

AUDIT_IMPL remained a worker/queue/capacity boundary and fixture-only dry-run posture.

AUDIT_IMPL findings:

- no worker started;
- no Redis or queue was created;
- no external HTTP audit was performed;
- no crawler ran;
- no scripts, packages, schemas, migrations, runtime files, deploy files, or server/cloud config changed;
- no Supabase, staging, production, Public API, MCP, public page, sitemap, data repo, or FermatMind repo mutation occurred;
- PR153 verifies no WAF bypass, no production write, no data repo mutation, and no public surface effect.

AUDIT_IMPL therefore proves audit safety boundaries, not real audit throughput or real observed project readiness.

## REPORT_IMPL Outcome Review

REPORT_IMPL0 found eligible methodology and limitation material, but not real project-level report data.

REPORT_IMPL findings:

- project-level scouted records are not eligible because no reviewed project-level implementation output exists in the train;
- audit result rows are not eligible because no external HTTP audit or executable local audit run occurred;
- no public report dataset exists;
- PR155 and PR156 are draft-only decisions;
- no public report page was created;
- no sitemap entry was created;
- no public JSON or report registry entry was created;
- no Public API or MCP surface was created;
- PR157 validates TTL/correction and no-public-surface boundaries.

The report drafts are useful for architecture planning and methodology framing. They are not strong enough for second-round Growth or public report-backed distribution because they lack real staging/audit observations, sample counts, reviewed project rows, and publishable datasets.

## Validation Summary

Baseline validation passed before PR158 edits:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify:day0` | PASS |
| `npm run policy:scan` | PASS |
| `npm run third-party:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:redact:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:batch:check` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:train-plan:check` | PASS |
| `npm run lint` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `npm run build` | PASS |
| `npm run agent:gate` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` | PASS |
| `npm run landscape:check` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-sector-density-boundary.mjs` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-task-discovery-boundary.mjs` | PASS |
| `node scripts/check-alternatives-canonical.mjs` | PASS |

`agent:train-plan:check` still prints the repository default `TRAIN-PR146-PR150-SCOUT-IMPL-PERSISTENCE` dry run while passing. PR158 scope is enforced separately by `agent:scope:check -- PR158` and changed-file review.

## Sidecar Findings

No new P0, P1, or P2 sidecar finding is created by PR158.

Existing `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md` contains older P3 gate-maintenance/checker lifecycle items. They are not blockers for this post-train decision because the required PR158 baseline checks pass and no implementation path is being started.

## Decision Gate Analysis

Option A, `GO_GROWTH2R_REPORT_BACKED_DISTRIBUTION`, is rejected.

Reason:

- no real local/staging audit data exists;
- no real project-level report dataset exists;
- report drafts do not include publishable sample counts, reviewed project rows, or current audit observations;
- no public report or distribution-ready material exists.

Option C, `GO_REPORT_PUBLICATION_CHECKPOINT`, is rejected.

Reason:

- report material is not ready for public page/sitemap checkpoint;
- REPORT_IMPL explicitly remains draft-only and no-public-surface.

Option B, `GO_ARCH0_BEFORE_SECOND_GROWTH`, is selected.

Reason:

- SCOUT outputs are local-only/docs/tmp-boundary only;
- AUDIT outputs are fixture-only/no-runtime only;
- REPORT outputs are draft-only/no-public-surface only;
- OPS-INFRA2X placement remains conditional;
- a worker/staging architecture decision is needed before real audit data or report-backed Growth can be produced.

## Chosen Next Lane

Chosen lane: architecture / worker / staging pipeline readiness first.

Next lane must decide the architecture before implementation:

- whether to create `88cn-scout-worker`;
- whether scout/audit/report pipeline code stays in 88CN or moves;
- staging-first architecture;
- worker repo boundary;
- queue/Redis boundary;
- no production worker;
- no Supabase migration without a later checkpoint;
- no Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 start.

## Exact Next Recommended Task

Exact next task:

`PR159 / ARCH0 - Worker Architecture + Repo Split Readiness Scan v0`

PR159 must remain a readiness scan. It must not create a repo, implement runtime code, create migrations, start workers, create Redis/queues, write staging or production, deploy, mutate cloud/server state, mutate the data repo, mutate FermatMind repos, or start Growth.
