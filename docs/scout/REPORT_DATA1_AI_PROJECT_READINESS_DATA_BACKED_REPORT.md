# REPORT_DATA1 AI Project Readiness Data-backed Report

Status: validation passed
Task: PR177 / REPORT_DATA1
Result: GO_REPORT_DATA2_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR177 creates an English aggregate draft decision using the PR176 eligibility boundary.

Result: `GO_REPORT_DATA2_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

This is a draft-only report decision, not a public report page, sitemap entry, public JSON file, report registry entry, Public API field, MCP surface, distribution pack, data repo export, external submission, or project-level publication.

## Checkpoint

PR177 has `human_checkpoint=true`.

The user said `继续执行`, so PR177 proceeds only as an English aggregate draft decision. This checkpoint resolution does not authorize:

- public report page creation;
- sitemap inclusion;
- public JSON or report registry entries;
- Public API or MCP exposure;
- data repo export or mutation;
- external distribution, search submission, social, email, DM, CRM, or outreach write;
- production, staging, or Supabase write;
- deploy or server/cloud mutation;
- project-level publication, ranking, benchmark, score, recommendation, or negative project claim.

## Data Basis

PR177 uses only the PR176 eligible aggregate evidence:

| Evidence | Count / status | Draft use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR171 staging dry-run source rows | `40` | Input-universe context only. |
| PR171 staging dry-run sample rows | `5` | Payload-shape context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture source rows | `40` | Input-universe context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture rows | `20` | Fixture-size context only. |
| PR172 staging no-publish QA | `PASS` | Safety/no-public-surface evidence. |
| PR175 audit worker runtime QA | `PASS` | No-runtime/no-external-audit evidence. |
| External HTTP audit rows | `0` | No project-level audit outcome exists. |
| Public report dataset rows | `0` | No public dataset exists. |

This data basis supports an aggregate readiness-process draft only. It does not support project readiness outcomes.

## Draft Thesis

The current 88CN worker, staging, audit, and report-data train is ready to describe pipeline readiness, not project readiness outcomes.

Allowed aggregate narrative:

- 88CN has defined and QA'd private-by-default staging and audit-worker boundaries.
- The current staging and audit artifacts are local-only and fixture-only.
- Current sample counts are bounded and transparent: 40 source rows, 5 staging dry-run sample rows, and 20 audit fixture rows.
- No external HTTP audit, browser fallback, worker runtime, queue, Redis, staging write, production write, public surface, report surface, Public API, MCP, sitemap, or data repo export occurred.
- Future public report publication requires reviewed project-level observations and a separate public-surface checkpoint.

Denied narrative:

- no claim that projects passed or failed readiness;
- no project ranking, score, benchmark, recommendation, or comparison;
- no website availability, traffic, revenue, user, financing, backer-interest, founder-verification, or growth claim;
- no project-level audit result;
- no public dataset, public report page, sitemap entry, Public API/MCP exposure, data repo export, or external distribution.

## Draft Report Skeleton

This skeleton may be reused by a later approved public report task only after reviewed report data exists.

1. Title: "AI Project Readiness Pipeline Status"
2. Scope: pipeline and governance readiness, not project performance.
3. Methodology: review of local staging, audit fixture, and QA artifacts.
4. Evidence: 40 local source rows, 5 staging sample rows, 20 audit fixture rows, and no-public/no-write QA.
5. Current result: aggregate draft-only; no project-level audit outcome exists.
6. Safety posture: no public route, no sitemap, no public JSON, no Public API, no MCP, no data repo export.
7. Limitations: no external HTTP audit, no worker runtime, no queue, no reviewed project observations.
8. Next approval needed: reviewed data, TTL/correction evidence, and public-surface checkpoint.

## TTL And Correction Policy

Any future report that uses real observations must include:

- observation date;
- data source class;
- stale label when the observation ages out;
- correction request path;
- re-audit or re-review path;
- bounded wording for missing, blocked, timeout, unsupported, or stale sources;
- explicit separation between fixture rows and reviewed public observations.

Current PR177 has no project-level observations to age, correct, or publish.

## Handoff To PR178

PR178 / REPORT_DATA2 may create a Chinese outbound aggregate draft decision under the same no-public-surface boundary.

PR178 must not add:

- public page work;
- sitemap work;
- public JSON;
- Public API or MCP work;
- data repo export;
- external distribution or outreach;
- project-level claims;
- rankings, scores, comparisons, recommendations, or negative project wording.

PR178 has `human_checkpoint=true` and is not started here.

## What This PR Does Not Do

- Does not create a report page.
- Does not create a sitemap entry.
- Does not create public JSON or a report registry entry.
- Does not expose Public API or MCP fields.
- Does not create a distribution pack.
- Does not mutate the data repo.
- Does not run audits, workers, crawlers, browser fallback, or external writes.
- Does not write Supabase, staging, or production databases.
- Does not deploy or mutate server/cloud config.
- Does not mutate FermatMind repos.
