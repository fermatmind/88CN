# REPORT_IMPL1 AI Project Readiness Aggregate Report v0

Status: validation passed
Task: PR155 / REPORT_IMPL1
Result: GO_REPORT_IMPL2_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR155 creates a draft-only aggregate report decision based on PR154 eligibility.

Result: `GO_REPORT_IMPL2_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

This is not a public report page, sitemap entry, public JSON file, report registry entry, Public API field, MCP surface, distribution pack, data repo export, external submission, or project-level publication.

## Draft Thesis

The current SCOUT/AUDIT implementation train is ready to describe process readiness, not project readiness outcomes.

Allowed aggregate narrative:

- 88CN has defined private-by-default scouted sandbox boundaries.
- Sandbox persistence remains local/docs/tmp-only.
- Worker, queue, external audit, and report-publication boundaries are explicitly checkpointed.
- No unreviewed scouted records have entered public frontend, sitemap, Public API, MCP, reports, distribution packs, Supabase, or the data repo.
- Future report publication requires reviewed data and a separate public-surface checkpoint.

Denied aggregate narrative:

- no claim that projects passed or failed readiness;
- no ranking, score, benchmark, market map, traction claim, or founder verification claim;
- no current audit finding;
- no project-level inclusion;
- no comparison table;
- no "top", "best", "leading", or outcome-promising language.

## Draft Report Skeleton

This skeleton may be reused by a later approved public report task only after reviewed report data exists.

1. Title: "AI Project Readiness Boundary Status"
2. Scope: implementation readiness, not project performance.
3. Methodology: local docs/status review of SCOUT/AUDIT boundaries.
4. Current result: draft-only; no publishable project-level dataset.
5. Safety posture: no public route, no sitemap, no Public API, no MCP, no data repo mutation.
6. Limitations: no live audit run, no project-level records, no current external observations.
7. Next approval needed: reviewed dataset and public-surface checkpoint.

## TTL And Correction Policy

Any future report must apply the earlier report TTL and correction posture:

- every observation needs an observation date;
- stale observations need a stale label;
- missing audit data must not become a permanent negative claim;
- correction and re-audit paths must be named;
- project-level statements require reviewed records;
- all negative wording must be dated and bounded.

## Publication Boundary

PR155 does not approve:

- report route implementation;
- report registry entry;
- sitemap inclusion;
- public JSON;
- Public API exposure;
- MCP exposure;
- distribution pack source;
- external search ping;
- social, email, DM, CRM, or outreach write;
- data repo mutation;
- deploy.

## Handoff To PR156

`PR156 / REPORT_IMPL2` may create a Chinese outbound draft-only decision under the same no-public-surface boundary. Translation must preserve policy-safe wording and must not add project-level claims, rankings, public-page work, sitemap work, API/MCP work, data repo exports, or outreach actions.

## Handoff To PR157

`PR157 / REPORT_IMPLQ` should QA PR154-PR156 and verify report eligibility, TTL/correction handling, no-public-page boundaries, no-sitemap boundaries, and no API/MCP/data-repo mutation.
