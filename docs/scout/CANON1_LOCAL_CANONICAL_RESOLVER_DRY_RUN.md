# CANON1 Local Canonical Resolver Dry Run

Status: validation passed
Task: PR167 / CANON1
Result: PASS_LOCAL_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_DRY_RUN
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR167 ran a local-only canonical resolver dry run over the PR164 local Seed identity pack.

Result: `PASS_LOCAL_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_DRY_RUN`.

Meaning:

- 40 local identity hints were normalized into provisional canonical candidates;
- no duplicates, ambiguity, or quarantine states were found in this bounded local sample;
- all resolver output remains under `/tmp`;
- no generated output is committed as official records;
- no canonical decision is public, reviewed, audited, published, Growth-ready, report-ready, or permanent.

## Checkpoint

PR167 has `human_checkpoint=true`.

The user explicitly said `继续执行`, so PR167 proceeded only inside the local-only, `/tmp` output, no-public, no-write boundary.

## Scope

In scope:

- use PR166 resolver boundary rules;
- run a local/fixture-only dry run over PR164 local output;
- normalize official URL, docs URL, source URL, and GitHub repo/org identity fields;
- produce local-only `/tmp` dry-run output;
- document counts and safety flags.

Out of scope:

- resolver implementation in repo code;
- external HTTP fetches;
- redirect following;
- DNS resolution;
- crawling;
- browser automation;
- Supabase migration or write;
- staging or production write;
- data repo mutation;
- committed generated resolver output;
- public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, report page, or distribution surface;
- audit trigger;
- Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 start.

## Inputs

Local inputs:

- `/tmp/88cn-pr164-seed-identity-hints-local-pack.jsonl`
- `/tmp/88cn-pr164-seed-identity-hints-manifest.json`
- `docs/scout/CANON0_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_BOUNDARY.md`

No external source was fetched.

## Local Output

Generated local-only output:

| File | Rows | Committed | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `/tmp/88cn-pr167-canonical-resolver-dry-run.jsonl` | 40 | No | Provisional normalized canonical candidate output. |
| `/tmp/88cn-pr167-canonical-resolver-manifest.json` | 1 | No | Counts, flags, and dry-run summary. |

The repository commits only this summary and status metadata.

## Dry Run Rules

The dry run applied PR166 rules locally:

- lowercase URL scheme and host;
- remove URL fragments;
- remove tracking query parameters such as `utm_*`, `ref`, `source`, and `fbclid`;
- normalize `www.` away for comparison only;
- parse GitHub owner/repo from public `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URLs;
- generate provisional `canonical_candidate_key`;
- keep identity states local-only;
- do not follow redirects;
- do not resolve DNS;
- do not fetch pages;
- do not infer identity from name-only matching.

## Output Fields

Local output fields:

```text
source_row
project_name
source_type
confidence
normalized_official_domain
normalized_official_url
normalized_docs_domain
normalized_docs_url
normalized_github_owner
normalized_github_repo
normalized_github_url
canonical_candidate_key
identity_conflict_state
canonical_decision_state
quarantine_reason
resolver_note
pr167_local_only
review_state
```

Forbidden output states were not used:

- `published`;
- `approved`;
- `claimed`;
- `owner_verified`;
- `audited`;
- `report_ready`;
- `growth_ready`;
- `sitemap_ready`;
- `public_api_ready`;
- `mcp_ready`.

## Dry Run Summary

Rows processed: 40.

By canonical decision state:

| State | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `canonical_candidate` | 40 |
| `ambiguous_review_required` | 0 |
| `duplicate_candidate` | 0 |
| `quarantined` | 0 |

By conflict state:

| State | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `none` | 40 |

By source type:

| Source type | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `github_repo` | 20 |
| `product_hunt` | 3 |
| `official_launch_page` | 6 |
| `official_site` | 6 |
| `manual_chinese_outbound` | 5 |

By confidence:

| Confidence | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `strong` | 21 |
| `medium` | 19 |

## Interpretation

`canonical_candidate` means a local resolver comparison key can be formed from public-safe identity fields. It is not a reviewed canonical record and not a public identity decision.

The sample has no duplicate or ambiguous rows because PR164 input was already small and identity-only. Larger future batches should expect duplicate, ambiguity, fork, wrapper, mirror, and template quarantine cases.

## No-Public / No-Write Proof

PR167 does not:

- commit generated resolver JSONL or manifest output;
- create official canonical records;
- perform external HTTP fetches;
- follow redirects;
- resolve DNS;
- run crawler or browser automation;
- mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- create Supabase migrations;
- write Supabase, staging, or production data;
- create or modify public routes;
- add sitemap entries;
- release Public API or MCP surfaces;
- create public report pages or report registry entries;
- trigger audit;
- deploy, SSH, or mutate cloud/server state;
- edit `.env`, read secrets, or print secrets;
- mutate FermatMind repos;
- start Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101.

## PR168 Handoff

PR168 / CANONQ should QA PR166-PR167.

Minimum checks for PR168:

- no name-only matching;
- ambiguous identities remain ambiguous;
- duplicate candidates are not merged permanently;
- local output fields are safe;
- generated resolver output stays under `/tmp` and is not committed;
- no public route, sitemap, data repo mutation, Supabase write, external HTTP, audit trigger, or project publication occurred.

Expected next result: `PASS_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_QA`.
