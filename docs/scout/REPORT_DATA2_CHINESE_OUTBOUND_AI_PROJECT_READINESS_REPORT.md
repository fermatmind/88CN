# REPORT_DATA2 Chinese Outbound AI Project Readiness Report

Status: validation passed
Task: PR178 / REPORT_DATA2
Result: GO_REPORT_DATAQ_QA_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR178 creates a Chinese outbound aggregate draft decision for the AI Project Readiness report lane.

Result: `GO_REPORT_DATAQ_QA_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

This is an internal draft decision for Chinese wording only. It is not a public report page, sitemap entry, public JSON file, report registry entry, Public API field, MCP surface, distribution pack, data repo export, external submission, social post, email, DM, CRM activity, deploy, or project-level publication.

## Checkpoint

PR178 has `human_checkpoint=true`.

The user said `继续执行`, so PR178 proceeds only as a Chinese aggregate draft decision. This checkpoint resolution does not authorize:

- public report page creation;
- sitemap inclusion;
- public JSON or report registry entries;
- Public API or MCP exposure;
- data repo export or mutation;
- external distribution, search submission, social, email, DM, CRM, or outreach write;
- production, staging, or Supabase write;
- deploy or server/cloud mutation;
- project-level publication, ranking, benchmark, score, recommendation, or negative project claim.

## Data Basis

PR178 uses only the PR176 and PR177 aggregate evidence:

| Evidence | Count / status | Chinese draft use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR171 staging dry-run source rows | `40` | Input-universe context only. |
| PR171 staging dry-run sample rows | `5` | Payload-shape context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture source rows | `40` | Input-universe context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture rows | `20` | Fixture-size context only. |
| PR172 staging no-publish QA | `PASS` | Safety/no-public-surface evidence. |
| PR175 audit worker runtime QA | `PASS` | No-runtime/no-external-audit evidence. |
| PR177 English aggregate draft | `validation passed` | Source wording boundary. |
| External HTTP audit rows | `0` | No project-level audit outcome exists. |
| Public report dataset rows | `0` | No public dataset exists. |

This basis supports only a process-readiness Chinese draft. It does not support project readiness outcomes.

## Chinese Draft Boundary

Allowed Chinese narrative:

- 88CN currently has a private-by-default staging and audit governance lane.
- Current evidence is local-only and fixture-only.
- Current sample counts are bounded and transparent: 40 source rows, 5 staging dry-run sample rows, and 20 audit fixture rows.
- No external HTTP audit, browser fallback, worker runtime, queue, Redis, staging write, production write, public surface, report surface, Public API, MCP, sitemap, or data repo export occurred.
- A future public Chinese report requires reviewed project-level observations and a separate public-surface checkpoint.

Denied Chinese narrative:

- no statement that any project passed or failed readiness;
- no project ranking, score, benchmark, recommendation, or comparison;
- no website availability, traffic, revenue, users, financing, backer-interest, founder-verification, or growth claim;
- no project-level audit result;
- no public dataset, public report page, sitemap entry, Public API/MCP exposure, data repo export, or external distribution.

## Chinese Outbound Draft Skeleton

This skeleton is wording guidance only. It must not be externally distributed without a later explicit approval task.

1. Title: "AI 项目就绪度流程状态"
2. Scope: pipeline and governance readiness only, not project performance.
3. Methodology: local staging, audit fixture, and QA artifact review.
4. Evidence: 40 local source rows, 5 staging sample rows, 20 audit fixture rows, and no-public/no-write QA.
5. Current result: aggregate draft-only; no project-level audit outcome exists.
6. Safety posture: no public route, no sitemap, no public JSON, no Public API, no MCP, no data repo export.
7. Limitations: no external HTTP audit, no worker runtime, no queue, no reviewed project observations.
8. Next approval needed: reviewed data, TTL/correction evidence, and public-surface checkpoint.

## Suggested Chinese Wording

The following wording is an internal draft only:

> 88CN 当前可以描述的是 AI 项目数据管线与治理流程的准备状态，而不是任何单个项目的就绪度结论。现有证据来自本地 staging dry-run、fixture-only audit dry-run 和 no-publish QA：40 条本地来源行、5 条 staging dry-run 样本行、20 条 audit fixture 行。当前没有外部 HTTP 审计、浏览器 fallback、worker runtime、队列、Redis、staging 写入、production 写入、public surface、report surface、Public API、MCP、sitemap 或 data repo export。因此，本阶段只能形成 aggregate draft，不应形成项目级排名、评分、推荐、通过/未通过结论或外部分发稿件。

## Translation Review Rules

Any future Chinese public report must preserve these rules:

- keep "pipeline readiness" separate from "project readiness";
- keep fixture rows separate from reviewed public observations;
- translate missing or unavailable evidence as "未验证", "仅限公开信号", "数据不足", "项目方未认领", or "来源不可用" when relevant;
- avoid claims about revenue, users, financing, traffic, backer interest, founder verification, or growth unless reviewed evidence exists;
- include observation date, stale label, correction request path, and re-review path before public use;
- require a separate public-surface task before page, sitemap, public JSON, API/MCP, data repo export, or distribution.

## Handoff To PR179

PR179 / REPORT_DATAQ may QA the report dataset boundary, TTL/correction wording, aggregate-only claims, and no-public-surface guarantees.

PR179 must not add:

- public page work;
- sitemap work;
- public JSON;
- Public API or MCP work;
- data repo export;
- external distribution or outreach;
- project-level claims;
- rankings, scores, comparisons, recommendations, or negative project wording.

## What This PR Does Not Do
