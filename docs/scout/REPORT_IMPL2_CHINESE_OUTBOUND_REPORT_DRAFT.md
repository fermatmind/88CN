# REPORT_IMPL2 Chinese Outbound AI Project Readiness Report v0

Status: validation passed
Task: PR156 / REPORT_IMPL2
Result: GO_REPORT_IMPLQ_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR156 creates a Chinese outbound draft-only decision based on PR154 eligibility and PR155 aggregate draft boundaries.

Result: `GO_REPORT_IMPLQ_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

This is not a public Chinese report page, sitemap entry, public JSON file, report registry entry, Public API field, MCP surface, distribution pack, data repo export, external submission, social post, email, DM, CRM write, or project-level publication.

## Chinese Draft Positioning

Allowed Chinese positioning:

- `AI 项目准备度边界状态`
- `本稿只描述 88CN 当前方法论、边界和限制。`
- `当前材料不足以发布项目级结论。`
- `后续公开发布需要经过数据复核和公开页面检查点。`

Denied Chinese positioning:

- no project rankings;
- no verified traction claims;
- no founder verification claims;
- no investment, yield, or outcome promises;
- no paid exposure promises;
- no current audit findings;
- no project-level inclusion list;
- no external outreach call to action.

## Draft Structure

1. 标题：`AI 项目准备度边界状态`
2. 范围：方法论和边界状态，不是项目表现报告。
3. 数据状态：当前没有可公开发布的项目级数据集。
4. 安全边界：无公开页面、无 sitemap、无 Public API、无 MCP、无数据仓库导出。
5. 限制：没有 live audit run，没有项目级审计结果，没有当前外部观察。
6. 下一步：需要经过数据复核和公开发布检查点。

## Translation Review Requirements

Any future Chinese public report task must verify:

- translation preserves the English source meaning;
- no new claim is introduced during translation;
- no project-level status is implied;
- no ranking, revenue, user, funding, backer, or verification claim is introduced;
- no public page, sitemap, public JSON, Public API, MCP, data repo, or outreach action is added;
- stale and dated observation language is preserved;
- correction and re-audit language is preserved.

## Publication Boundary

PR156 does not approve:

- Chinese report route implementation;
- Chinese report registry entry;
- sitemap inclusion;
- public JSON;
- Public API exposure;
- MCP exposure;
- distribution pack source;
- external search ping;
- WeChat, social, email, DM, CRM, or outreach write;
- data repo mutation;
- deploy.

## Handoff To PR157

`PR157 / REPORT_IMPLQ` should QA PR154-PR156 and verify:

- report data eligibility remains draft-only;
- TTL/correction posture is preserved;
- Chinese wording stays policy-safe;
- no public page, sitemap, public JSON, report registry entry, Public API, MCP, distribution pack, data repo mutation, external submission, or outreach action exists.
