# CANONQ Canonical Resolver QA

Status: validation passed
Task: PR168 / CANONQ
Result: PASS_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_QA
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR168 QA verifies PR166 and PR167.

Result: `PASS_CANONICAL_RESOLVER_QA`.

Meaning:

- canonical resolver policy exists;
- PR167 local dry-run output is local-only and safe;
- no name-only canonical keys were produced;
- no public, reviewed, audited, report-ready, Growth-ready, sitemap-ready, Public API-ready, or MCP-ready states were produced;
- no resolver implementation, external HTTP, data repo mutation, Supabase write, public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, report surface, audit trigger, or project publication occurred.

## Reviewed Scope

## Local Output QA

Rows reviewed: 40.

By canonical decision state:

| State | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `canonical_candidate` | 40 |
| `ambiguous_review_required` | 0 |
| `duplicate_candidate` | 0 |
| `quarantined` | 0 |

By conflict state:

| State | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `none` | 40 |

The bounded PR164 sample produced no duplicate or ambiguous identities. This is acceptable for the sample and does not imply larger batches are duplicate-free.

## Schema QA

PR168 verifies local output uses only safe resolver fields:

```text
source_row
project_name
source_type
confidence
normalized_official_domain
normalized_official_url
normalized_docs_domain
normalized_docs_url
normalized_github_owner
normalized_github_repo
normalized_github_url
canonical_candidate_key
identity_conflict_state
canonical_decision_state
quarantine_reason
resolver_note
pr167_local_only
review_state
```

No unexpected fields were found.

## Name-Only Matching QA

PR168 verifies:

- no `canonical_candidate_key` is based on name-only matching;
- keys use domain, GitHub repo, docs domain, source domain, or explicit local fallback evidence;
- `project_name` is retained as display/source context only;
- no candidate is merged or published from name similarity.

## Ambiguity / Duplicate QA

PR168 verifies:

- ambiguous state handling is defined by PR166;
- duplicate candidate handling is defined by PR166;
- PR167 did not produce duplicate candidates in this bounded sample;
- no permanent merge decision was made;
- no quarantine bypass occurred.

## No-Public / No-Write QA

PR168 verifies no changes were made to:

- `app/**`;
- `components/**`;
- `lib/**`;
- `scripts/**`;
- `supabase/**`;
- `deploy/**`;
- `middleware.ts`;
- `package.json`;
- `package-lock.json`;
- `public/**`;
- `.env*`;
- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data/**`.

Manifest flags verified:

| Flag | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `local_only` | `true` |
| `external_http` | `false` |
| `data_repo_mutation` | `false` |
| `supabase_write` | `false` |
| `staging_write` | `false` |
| `production_write` | `false` |
| `public_surface` | `false` |
| `audit_trigger` | `false` |

No canonical output entered:

- public frontend;
- sitemap;
- Public API;
- MCP;
- `/landscape`;
- `/tasks`;
- alternatives pages;
- public report pages;
- report registry;
- public JSON;
- distribution packs.
