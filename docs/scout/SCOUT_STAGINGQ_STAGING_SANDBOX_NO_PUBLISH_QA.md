All sampled rows keep `dry_run_only=true` and `review_state=not_reviewed_not_public_not_audited`.

## No-Publish QA Matrix

| Surface | QA result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthorized staging write | Pass | PR171 manifest records `attempted_staging_write=false` and `staging_write_authorized=false`. |
| Supabase write | Pass | PR169-PR171 changed no `supabase/**`, no runtime storage code, and PR171 manifest records `supabase_write=false`. |
| Production write | Pass | PR171 manifest records `production_write=false`; no runtime write path changed. |
| Public route / frontend | Pass | Reviewed range changed no `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, `middleware.ts`, or `public/**`. |
| Sitemap | Pass | Reviewed range changed no sitemap runtime or public route registry. |
| Public API / MCP | Pass | Reviewed range changed no API route, MCP route, or Public API serializer. |
| Reports | Pass | Reviewed range changed no report page, report registry, public JSON, or distribution surface. |
| `/landscape`, `/tasks`, alternatives | Pass | Reviewed range changed no route code or registries for these public surfaces. |
| Data repo | Pass | `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` remains on clean `main...origin/main`; PR169-PR171 changed no data-repo files. |
| Worker / crawler / queue | Pass | Reviewed range changed no worker runtime, crawler, Redis/queue, package, script, or server config. |
| External HTTP audit | Pass | No audit trigger or external HTTP audit was run; PR171 manifest records `audit_trigger=false`. |
| PII / copied competitor content | Pass | PR171 dry-run payload uses identity hints only and contains no PII, copied descriptions, rankings, scores, traffic, reviews, or recommendations. |

## Train Closure

`TRAIN-PR169-PR172-SCOUT-STAGING` is complete with local/docs-only outputs:

- PR169 defined the staging sandbox persistence boundary.
- PR170 kept storage/migration local-only and did not authorize schema or write work.
- PR171 recorded a local-only write dry-run with `STAGING_WRITE_NOT_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_ONLY`.
- PR172 verifies no-publish and no-write boundaries.

## Next Checkpoint

Exact next task: PR173 / AUDIT_WORKER0 in `TRAIN-PR173-PR175-AUDIT-WORKER`.
