# SCOUT_STAGING2 Staging Sandbox Write Dry Run

Status: validation passed
Task: PR171 / SCOUT_STAGING2
Result: PASS_SCOUT_STAGING_LOCAL_DRY_RUN
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR171 performs a local-only staging sandbox write dry-run.

Result: `PASS_SCOUT_STAGING_LOCAL_DRY_RUN`.

Because no explicit staging DB write authorization was granted, this task records:

```text
STAGING_WRITE_NOT_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_ONLY
```

No Supabase, staging, or production write was attempted.

## Checkpoint

PR171 has `human_checkpoint=true`.

The user said `继续执行`, so PR171 proceeds only as a local-only dry-run. This checkpoint resolution does not authorize a real staging DB write, Supabase migration, production write, runtime storage code, worker, crawler, audit trigger, data repo mutation, public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, report surface, deploy, or server/cloud mutation.

## Inputs

Local input artifacts:

- `/tmp/88cn-pr167-canonical-resolver-dry-run.jsonl`
- `docs/scout/SCOUT_STAGING1_STAGING_SANDBOX_STORAGE_MIGRATION_CHECKPOINT.md`

The PR167 local canonical resolver output remains an uncommitted `/tmp` artifact. It is not an official Seed 100 dataset, not a staging database rowset, not reviewed public records, not audited records, and not report data.

## Local Output

Local dry-run manifest:

```text
/tmp/88cn-pr171-staging-sandbox-local-write-dry-run.json
```

Dry-run summary:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `result` | `PASS_SCOUT_STAGING_LOCAL_DRY_RUN` |
| `local_only` | `true` |
| `dry_run_only` | `true` |
| `source_row_count` | `40` |
| `sample_count` | `5` |
| `staging_write_status` | `STAGING_WRITE_NOT_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_ONLY` |

## Dry-Run Payload Shape

The local sample payload uses only staging-candidate identity and review-boundary fields:

```text
source_row
staging_status
project_name_hint
official_website_url
github_url
normalized_official_domain
normalized_github_owner
normalized_github_repo
canonical_candidate_key
source_confidence
quarantine_reason
ttl_expires_at
dry_run_only
review_state
```

All sample rows keep `dry_run_only=true` and `review_state=not_reviewed_not_public_not_audited`.

## No-Write Proof

The local manifest records:

| Guard | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `attempted_staging_write` | `false` |
| `staging_write_authorized` | `false` |
| `supabase_write` | `false` |
| `staging_write` | `false` |
| `production_write` | `false` |
| `data_repo_mutation` | `false` |
| `public_surface` | `false` |
| `audit_trigger` | `false` |

No migration, schema, runtime storage path, worker, crawler, Redis/queue, external HTTP audit, deploy, server/cloud mutation, public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, report surface, data repo mutation, Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 work occurs.
