# SCOUT_SEED1 Seed 100 Identity Hint Local Pack

Status: validation passed
Task: PR164 / SCOUT_SEED1
Result: PASS_SCOUT_SEED40_LOCAL_PACK_WITH_FINDINGS
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR164 produced a local-only identity hint pack from bounded Seed50R research input.

Result: `PASS_SCOUT_SEED40_LOCAL_PACK_WITH_FINDINGS`.

Meaning:

- 40 strong/medium identity hints passed local structural revalidation;
- 12 weak or rejected hints remain separated in a rejected/weak local file;
- exact Seed 100 count was not forced because only 40 bounded candidates met the PR163 source policy;
- all generated output remains under `/tmp`;
- no generated pack is committed as an official record;
- no candidate is reviewed, published, audited, indexed, Growth-ready, report-ready, or public.

## Scope

In scope:

- read Seed50R `/tmp` artifacts as research input only;
- revalidate allowed keys, URL parseability, source type, confidence, and weak/directory separation;
- normalize accepted hints into a local-only identity pack under `/tmp`;
- keep rejected/weak hints separate under `/tmp`;
- document manifest counts and no-public/no-write proof.

Out of scope:

- producing exactly 100 candidates when quality is insufficient;
- committing generated JSONL packs into the repository;
- mutating `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- Supabase, staging, or production writes;
- public routes, sitemap, Public API, MCP, report registry, public JSON, or distribution packs;
- external HTTP fetching, crawler, or audit trigger;
- Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 start.

## Inputs

Seed50R source files were read only as local research input:

- `/tmp/88cn-seed50-source-research.md`
- `/tmp/88cn-seed50-candidate-hints-preview.jsonl`
- `/tmp/88cn-seed50-rejected-or-weak-hints.jsonl`

These inputs are not official 88CN records and are not public records.

## Local Output

Generated local-only output:

| File | Rows | Committed | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `/tmp/88cn-pr164-seed-identity-hints-local-pack.jsonl` | 40 | No | Accepted local identity hints. |
| `/tmp/88cn-pr164-seed-identity-hints-rejected-or-weak.jsonl` | 12 | No | Rejected or weak hints for later manual review. |
| `/tmp/88cn-pr164-seed-identity-hints-manifest.json` | 1 | No | Counts, flags, and validation summary. |

The repository commits only this summary and status metadata.

## Revalidation Rules

Accepted hints had to satisfy all of the following local checks:

- JSONL row parses successfully;
- no unknown or forbidden keys;
- required fields are present;
- URL fields parse as `http` or `https` URLs;
- `source_type` is in the PR163 allowlist;
- `confidence` is `strong` or `medium`;
- `source_type` is not `directory_hint`;
- hint does not carry public, review, publish, audit, sitemap, Growth, score, ranking, traffic, review, recommendation, category, email, phone, or description fields.

Allowed identity fields from PR163:

```text
project_name
official_website_url
github_url
docs_url
source_url
source_type
discovered_at
confidence
manual_note
```

The local `/tmp` accepted output adds local state fields:

```text
pr164_local_only
record_state
review_state
```

Those state fields are local manifest guardrails only. They are not public lifecycle states and are not committed as project records.

## Accepted Pack Summary

Accepted local hints: 40.

By source type:

| Source type | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `github_repo` | 20 |
| `product_hunt` | 3 |
| `official_launch_page` | 6 |
| `official_site` | 6 |
| `manual_chinese_outbound` | 5 |

By confidence:

| Confidence | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `strong` | 21 |
| `medium` | 19 |

No weak accepted hints were promoted.

## Rejected / Weak Summary

Rejected or weak local hints: 12.

Reasons:

| Reason | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `directory_only` | 9 |
| `copied_copy_risk` | 1 |
| `no_official_site` | 1 |
| `PII_risk` | 1 |

Rejected and weak hints are incomplete evidence. They are not failed projects and must not become negative public claims.

## Findings

PR164 deliberately stops at 40 accepted local hints.

Reason: the bounded Seed50R input contained only 40 strong/medium identity hints that passed PR163 policy and local structural revalidation. The task policy says not to force exact 100 when quality is insufficient.

Next useful work belongs in later explicitly scoped seed discovery or manual review tasks, not in PR164.

## No-Public / No-Write Proof

PR164 does not:

- commit generated JSONL packs;
- commit Seed 100 records;
- mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- create Supabase migrations;
- write Supabase, staging, or production data;
- perform external HTTP fetching;
- run a crawler or audit worker;
- trigger an audit;
- create or modify public routes;
- add sitemap entries;
- release Public API or MCP surfaces;
- create public report pages or report registry entries;
- deploy, SSH, or mutate cloud/server state;
- edit `.env`, read secrets, or print secrets;
- mutate FermatMind repos;
- start Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101.

## PR165 Handoff

PR165 / SCOUT_SEEDQ should QA PR163-PR164.

Minimum checks for PR165:

- local pack schema uses allowed keys only;
- rejected/weak hints remain separate;
- no competitor copy, categories, rankings, scores, traffic, reviews, recommendations, PII, emails, phones, private handles, public status, audit status, or Growth status exists;
- generated packs stay under `/tmp` and are not committed;
- no public route, sitemap, data repo mutation, Supabase write, or audit trigger occurred.

Expected next result: `PASS_SCOUT_SEED_NO_COPY_QA`.
