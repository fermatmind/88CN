# SCOUT_IMPL3 Local Sandbox Write Dry Run v0

Status: validation passed
Task: PR149 / SCOUT_IMPL3
Result: GO_SCOUT_IMPLQ_LOCAL_ONLY
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR149 records the dry-run decision for SCOUT_IMPL3 under the PR148 storage checkpoint.

Result: `GO_SCOUT_IMPLQ_LOCAL_ONLY`.

The approved path remains local-only and docs/tmp-artifact-only. This PR does not perform a staging database write, production database write, Supabase migration, runtime storage write, crawler run, worker run, queue operation, public route change, sitemap change, Public API change, MCP change, data repo mutation, or FermatMind repo mutation.

## Dry-Run Decision

The current train does not need a durable database write to prove the no-publish sandbox boundary. A future local dry-run may write disposable artifacts under `/tmp` only if a later task explicitly defines or invokes that dry-run command.

Approved dry-run posture:

- local-only;
- disposable output under `/tmp`;
- no committed generated output;
- no staging database;
- no production database;
- no Supabase migration;
- no runtime worker;
- no crawler or external HTTP batch audit;
- no public route effect;
- no sitemap effect;
- no Public API or MCP exposure;
- no data repo mutation.

## Allowed Future Local Artifact Shape

If a later approved task creates a local dry-run artifact, the artifact should be bounded and redacted:

| Field class | Example | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run metadata | `run_id`, `generated_at`, `task_id`, `source_fixture_id` | Local-only and timestamped. |
| Candidate count | `observed_count`, `eligible_count`, `quarantined_count` | Aggregate counts only by default. |
| Boundary flags | `no_public_surface`, `no_sitemap`, `no_api_mcp`, `no_db_write` | Must be true for this train. |
| Redaction status | `pii_detected`, `private_data_detected`, `redaction_passed` | PII/private data must fail or quarantine. |
| Freshness | `snapshot_at`, `stale_after` | Required before report reuse. |
| Limitations | `source_exclusions`, `fixture_limitations` | Must name what the dry-run did not inspect. |

Project-level candidate rows are not approved for committed output. If a local artifact contains candidate-level rows under `/tmp`, they must use public-safe fields only and must not include PII, private data, raw HTML dumps, copied competitor text, public slugs, sitemap flags, or publication lifecycle states.

## Staging Write Boundary

Actual staging DB write remains not approved by this PR.

Before any staging write exists or runs, a later checkpoint must provide:

1. Exact approved task ID.
2. Exact staging target.
3. Exact write command or route.
4. Exact table/contract.
5. Allowed and denied fields.
6. PII/private-data denial.
7. Rollback/delete plan.
8. No production write guarantee.
9. No public route effect.
10. No sitemap effect.
11. No Public API or MCP exposure.
12. No data repo mutation.

No production write is allowed in this train.

## No-Publish Guarantees

SCOUT_IMPL3 preserves the no-publish posture from PR147 and PR148:

- scouted records do not enter public frontend pages;
- scouted records do not enter sitemap output;
- scouted records do not enter Public API or MCP responses;
- scouted records do not enter `/landscape`, `/tasks`, alternatives, reports, or distribution packs;
- scouted records do not enter Supabase;
- scouted records do not enter `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`.

## Handoff To PR150

`PR150 / SCOUT_IMPLQ` should QA the completed PR146-PR149 persistence train and verify:

- PR146 kept implementation in the 88CN control repo and did not create a worker repo/package;
- PR147 defined private-by-default sandbox persistence boundaries;
- PR148 selected local/docs/tmp-only storage;
- PR149 did not perform staging or production writes;
- no migration, runtime storage path, public surface, sitemap change, Public API, MCP, or data repo mutation appeared across PR146-PR149.
