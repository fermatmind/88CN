# AUDIT_WORKERQ Audit Worker Runtime QA

Status: validation passed
Task: PR175 / AUDIT_WORKERQ
Result: PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_RUNTIME_QA
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR175 verifies PR173-PR174 and closes `TRAIN-PR173-PR175-AUDIT-WORKER`.

Result: `PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_RUNTIME_QA`.

The audit worker train remains docs/local-fixture-only. No unapproved worker, queue, browser fallback, external audit, write, deploy, public surface, report surface, or data repo mutation occurred.

## PR174 Manifest QA

Local PR174 manifest:

```text
/tmp/88cn-pr174-small-batch-audit-fixture-dry-run.json
```

Manifest checks:

| Field | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| `result` | `PASS_AUDIT_WORKER_FIXTURE_DRY_RUN` |
| `local_only` | `true` |
| `fixture_only` | `true` |
| `dry_run_only` | `true` |
| `external_http_allowed` | `false` |
| `external_http_attempted` | `false` |
| `browser_fallback_allowed` | `false` |
| `browser_attempted` | `false` |
| `worker_started` | `false` |
| `queue_created` | `false` |
| `redis_used` | `false` |
| `supabase_write` | `false` |
| `staging_write` | `false` |
| `production_write` | `false` |
| `data_repo_mutation` | `false` |

| `public_api_mcp` | `false` |
| `deploy_or_server_mutation` | `false` |
| `source_row_count` | `40` |
| `fixture_count` | `20` |

The fixture payload contains only local identity and boundary fields. It is not audited data, not public data, and not report-eligible data.

## Runtime QA Matrix

| Boundary | QA result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker runtime | Pass | PR173-PR174 changed no runtime, package, script, PM2, deploy, or server config path; PR174 manifest records `worker_started=false`. |
| Redis/queue | Pass | PR173-PR174 changed no queue or Redis path; PR174 manifest records `queue_created=false` and `redis_used=false`. |
| External HTTP audit | Pass | PR174 is fixture-only; manifest records `external_http_allowed=false` and `external_http_attempted=false`. |
| Browser fallback | Pass | PR173 prohibits browser fallback by default; PR174 manifest records `browser_fallback_allowed=false` and `browser_attempted=false`. |
| WAF/proxy bypass | Pass | No external request or browser action occurred. |
| Supabase/staging/production write | Pass | No DB/runtime path changed; PR174 manifest records all write flags false. |
| Public route / frontend | Pass | Reviewed range changed no `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, `middleware.ts`, or `public/**`. |
| Sitemap / Public API / MCP | Pass | Reviewed range changed no sitemap runtime, API route, MCP route, or Public API serializer. |
| Report surface | Pass | Reviewed range changed no report page, report registry, public JSON, or distribution surface; PR174 manifest records `report_surface=false`. |
| Data repo | Pass | `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` remains on clean `main...origin/main`; PR173-PR174 changed no data-repo files. |
| Server/cloud mutation | Pass | Reviewed range changed no deploy/server/cloud path; PR174 manifest records `deploy_or_server_mutation=false`. |
| Generated artifacts | Pass | PR174 manifest remains under `/tmp` and is not committed as data. |

## Train Closure

`TRAIN-PR173-PR175-AUDIT-WORKER` is complete with docs/local-fixture-only outputs:

- PR173 defined the HTTP-first audit worker boundary and capacity model.
- PR174 recorded a fixture-only local small-batch dry-run with no external HTTP audit.
- PR175 verifies no runtime, queue, external audit, browser, write, deploy, public, report, or data-repo leakage.

## Next Checkpoint

Exact next task: PR176 / REPORT_DATA0 in `TRAIN-PR176-PR179-REPORT-DATA`.

PR176 has `human_checkpoint=true` and `auto_merge_allowed=false`. It is not started here.
