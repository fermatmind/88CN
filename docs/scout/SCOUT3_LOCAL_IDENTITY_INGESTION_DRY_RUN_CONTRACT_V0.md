# SCOUT3 Local Identity Ingestion Dry Run Contract v0

Status: validation passed  
Task: PR140 / SCOUT3  
Result: PASS_LOCAL_IDENTITY_INGESTION_DRY_RUN_CONTRACT  
Date: 2026-06-20

## Decision

PR140 stops at a local identity ingestion dry-run contract because the current roadmap scope allows docs/status/task metadata only. It does not create an executable dry-run, script, package command, committed output, resolver implementation, crawler, external fetch, database schema, migration, public route, sitemap change, Public API change, MCP tool, deployment, Supabase write, or companion data repo mutation.

## Future Dry-Run Inputs

Future implementation, if separately approved, may read only local sandbox candidate fixtures that satisfy:

- SCOUT1 source policy;
- SCOUT2 sandbox contract;
- SCOUT4 canonical resolver boundary;
- no private/contact-like fields;
- no copied restricted source text;
- no login, cookie, form, browser session, or bypass dependency.

## Future Dry-Run Output

Output must default outside the repo, for example `/tmp/88cn-scout3-identity-dry-run`, and include:

```json
{
  "dry_run_version": "scout3_identity_ingestion_v0",
  "input_count": 0,
  "accepted_count": 0,
  "quarantined_count": 0,
  "rejected_count": 0,
  "public_surface_changed": false,
  "external_write_performed": false,
  "supabase_write_performed": false,
  "data_repo_mutated": false,
  "deploy_performed": false
}
```

Accepted output remains sandbox-only and must not create public slugs, public project records, sitemap entries, `/landscape` counts, `/tasks` matches, alternatives pairs, reports, Public API fields, or MCP fields.

## Negative Probes

A future implementation must reject:

- repo-internal output paths unless a later task explicitly allows committed fixtures;
- private contacts or personal emails;
- copied third-party descriptions;
- login-required source URLs;
- cookie/session inputs;
- private IP or localhost URLs;
- data repo output;
- any public-surface write flag set to true.

## Stop State

The only approved result of this PR is `PASS_LOCAL_IDENTITY_INGESTION_DRY_RUN_CONTRACT`. No local identity ingestion dry run was executed.
