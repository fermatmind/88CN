# REPORT2 Chinese Outbound Readiness Report Contract v0

Status: validation passed  
Task: PR143 / REPORT2  
Result: PASS_REPORT2_CONTRACT  
Date: 2026-06-20

## Decision

PR143 defines a contract for a future Chinese outbound AI project readiness report. It does not create a Chinese report page, translation file, generator, public registry entry, sitemap entry, distribution pack source, public JSON, Public API field, MCP tool, crawler, audit worker, external submission, deployment, Supabase write, or companion data repo mutation.

## Future Report Contract

A future draft report must include:

```json
{
  "report_version": "chinese_outbound_readiness_v0",
  "snapshot_date": "2026-06-20",
  "locale": "zh-CN-draft",
  "source_scope": "local_reviewed_sandbox_only",
  "freshness_policy": "REPORT0_TTL_CORRECTION_POLICY_V0",
  "translation_review_required": true,
  "public_surface_allowed": false,
  "sitemap_allowed": false,
  "public_api_allowed": false,
  "mcp_allowed": false,
  "external_distribution_allowed": false
}
```

## Language Boundary

Future Chinese copy must:

- keep timestamped observations;
- use original 88CN wording, not copied third-party descriptions;
- avoid permanent negative labels;
- avoid investment, financing, ranking, or outcome-promise language;
- clearly distinguish reviewed public signals from unknown fields;
- keep correction/re-audit paths visible to human reviewers.

## Required Review

Before any future public use, the draft must receive:

- source review;
- translation review;
- public-language policy scan;
- freshness review;
- correction path review;
- no-publish QA confirmation.

## Stop State

The only approved result of this PR is `PASS_REPORT2_CONTRACT`. No Chinese outbound report was generated, published, indexed, distributed, or added to a public registry.

## Handoff

SCOUTQ may verify that the full SCOUT/AUDIT/REPORT chain did not publish scouted records or create public surfaces.

Do not start SCOUTQ implementation beyond QA docs/status, second-round Growth, BETA1, I18N0, OPS8D, OPS10A, or PR101 from this PR.
