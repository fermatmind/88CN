# AUDIT_IMPL1 Small-Batch Audit Worker Dry Run v0

Status: validation passed
Task: PR152 / AUDIT_IMPL1
Result: GO_AUDIT_IMPLQ_FIXTURE_ONLY
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR152 records the small-batch audit dry-run posture under the PR151 capacity boundary.

Result: `GO_AUDIT_IMPLQ_FIXTURE_ONLY`.

The approved path is fixture-only and local/docs/tmp-artifact-only. This PR does not start a server worker, create Redis or queues, perform external HTTP audit, run a crawler, create scripts, change packages, deploy, mutate server/cloud config, write Supabase, write staging or production databases, expose public pages, change sitemap, release Public API/MCP surfaces, mutate the data repo, or mutate FermatMind repos.

## Dry-Run Decision

No live audit run is executed in PR152. The dry-run is documented as a contract because the registered PR152 scope only allows docs/status/current metadata.

Approved default:

- fixture-only;
- local-only;
- output under `/tmp` if a later approved command exists;
- no committed generated output;
- no external HTTP;
- no server worker;
- no Redis/queue;
- no Supabase write;
- no production write;
- no public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, or data repo effect.

## Fixture Batch Limits

A future fixture dry-run must remain bounded:

| Dimension | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Fixture records | 20 maximum per run |
| Runtime worker | None by default |
| External HTTP | None for fixture-only mode |
| Concurrency | 0 for fixture-only; 1 preferred for any later low-concurrency approved run |
| Timeout | 8 seconds maximum if a later network run is approved |
| Retries | 3 attempts maximum including initial attempt if a later network run is approved |
| Output path | `/tmp/88cn-audit-dry-run-*` only unless a later fixture task approves committed fixtures |
| Production write | Forbidden |
| Public exposure | Forbidden |

No heavy audit, broad crawl, full database scan, 2000-row run, 5000-row run, or 10000-row run is approved.

## Required Evidence Shape

If a later local command creates a dry-run artifact, it should contain:

| Field class | Example | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run metadata | `run_id`, `task_id`, `generated_at`, `mode` | `mode` must be `fixture_only` unless a later checkpoint changes it. |
| Input summary | `fixture_count`, `source_fixture`, `record_statuses` | Aggregate counts only by default. |
| Boundary flags | `external_http_allowed`, `worker_started`, `queue_created`, `db_write_allowed` | Must remain false for this mode. |
| Audit classification | `eligible`, `skipped`, `blocked`, `unsupported`, `stale` | No permanent negative labels. |
| Timing | `timeout_ms`, `retry_limit`, `cooldown_policy` | Must match PR151 limits. |
| Output safety | `redaction_passed`, `pii_detected`, `public_surface_effect` | PII/private data or public surface effects must fail the run. |

Project-level output must not be committed unless a later task explicitly approves redacted fixtures.

## Server/Staging Checkpoint Boundary

A low-concurrency staging/server audit dry-run is not approved by this PR.

Before any staging/server dry-run:

1. Name the exact approved task.
2. Confirm owner and capacity for the exact server target.
3. Confirm no `HK-ALIYUN-01`, FermatMind production, or Tencent workload placement.
4. Define exact command, queue, or worker entrypoint.
5. Define batch size, concurrency, timeout, retry, cooldown, and stop conditions.
6. Confirm no production database write.
7. Confirm no public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, or data repo effect.
8. Define rollback/kill procedure.
9. Confirm logs are redacted and bounded.

## Handoff To PR153

`PR153 / AUDIT_IMPLQ` should QA PR151 and PR152 by verifying:

- no worker runtime starts;
- no Redis/queue is created;
- no external HTTP audit is executed;
- no scripts, packages, schemas, migrations, or runtime files changed;
- no server/cloud mutation occurs;
- no public route, sitemap, Public API, MCP, Supabase write, data repo mutation, or FermatMind repo mutation occurs.
