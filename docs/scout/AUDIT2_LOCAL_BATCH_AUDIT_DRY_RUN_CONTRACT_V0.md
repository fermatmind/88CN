# AUDIT2 Local Batch Audit Dry Run Contract v0

Status: validation passed  
Task: PR141 / AUDIT2  
Result: PASS_LOCAL_BATCH_AUDIT_DRY_RUN_CONTRACT  
Date: 2026-06-20

## Decision

PR141 stops at a local batch audit dry-run contract because the current roadmap scope allows docs/status/task metadata only. It does not create an audit runner, queue, script, package command, committed output, external scan, browser automation, crawler, database write, public route, sitemap change, Public API change, MCP tool, deployment, Supabase write, or companion data repo mutation.

## Future Dry-Run Manifest

Future implementation, if separately approved, must emit a local-only manifest equivalent to:

```json
{
  "dry_run_version": "audit2_batch_audit_v0",
  "output_directory": "/tmp/88cn-audit2-batch-dry-run",
  "input_count": 0,
  "eligible_count": 0,
  "skipped_count": 0,
  "max_jobs": 20,
  "max_concurrency": 3,
  "timeout_seconds": 8,
  "max_attempts": 3,
  "external_write_performed": false,
  "public_surface_changed": false,
  "supabase_write_performed": false,
  "data_repo_mutated": false,
  "deploy_performed": false
}
```

## Future Summary Requirements

The dry-run summary must include:

- input status distribution;
- eligibility summary;
- skip reasons;
- per-host request plan;
- failure taxonomy counts;
- stale snapshot count;
- quarantine recommendation count;
- recheck-after dates;
- all safety flags set to false.

## Negative Probes

A future implementation must reject:

- non-public URLs;
- localhost/private IP URLs;
- login, form, cookie, or browser-session requirements;
- repo-internal output paths unless later allowed;
- data repo output;
- public route/sitemap/Public API/MCP mutation;
- external writes or deploy flags;
- broad crawl mode;
- attempts to zero out last successful snapshots after failed scans.

## Stop State

The only approved result of this PR is `PASS_LOCAL_BATCH_AUDIT_DRY_RUN_CONTRACT`. No local batch audit dry run was executed and no `/tmp` output is required for this docs-only task.

## Handoff

REPORT1 and REPORT2 may define report contracts after this dry-run contract. They must not publish reports or expose scouted records unless a later explicit public-surface task and SCOUTQ QA allow it.

Do not start REPORT1 implementation, REPORT2 implementation, SCOUTQ, second-round Growth, BETA1, I18N0, OPS8D, OPS10A, or PR101 from this PR.
