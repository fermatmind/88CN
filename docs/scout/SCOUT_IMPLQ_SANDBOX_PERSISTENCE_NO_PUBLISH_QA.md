| No scripts or package changes | Changed files contain no `scripts/**`, `package.json`, or `package-lock.json`. | PASS |

| No staging DB write | PR148 chose local/docs/tmp-only; PR149 documents no staging write. | PASS |
| No production write | PR146-PR149 all state no production write; no runtime write path changed. | PASS |

| No sitemap change | Changed files contain no sitemap route, registry, or public asset changes. | PASS |
| No Public API | Changed files contain no Public API route, serializer, schema, or docs release changes. | PASS |
| No MCP | Changed files contain no MCP runtime, schema, config, or tool exposure changes. | PASS |

## Task-Specific QA

| Task | QA finding | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR146 | Repo-split decision kept boundary/docs/local dry-run work in the 88CN control repo and did not create a worker repo/package. | PASS |
| PR147 | Persistence boundary denied PII, private data, copied competitor text, raw crawl dumps, public slugs, sitemap flags, and lifecycle promotion. | PASS |
| PR148 | Storage checkpoint selected local/docs/tmp-artifact-only and split any durable storage to later approval. | PASS |
| PR149 | Dry-run boundary stayed local-only and did not execute staging or production writes. | PASS |

## Handoff To PR151

`PR151 / AUDIT_IMPL0` is the next registered task and starts the audit implementation worker boundary train.

Carry forward these guarantees:

- no worker runtime starts without a later approved task;
- no Redis/queue creation;
- no external HTTP batch audit unless fixture-only and explicitly scoped;
- no production database write;
- no public page, sitemap, Public API, MCP, or data repo mutation;
- OPS-INFRA2X placement constraints remain the infrastructure source of truth.
