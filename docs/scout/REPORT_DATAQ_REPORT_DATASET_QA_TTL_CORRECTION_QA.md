# REPORT_DATAQ Report Dataset QA + TTL Correction QA

Status: validation passed
Task: PR179 / REPORT_DATAQ
Result: PASS_REPORT_DATA_QA_TTL_CORRECTION_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR179 verifies the report-data train from PR176 through PR178.

Result: `PASS_REPORT_DATA_QA_TTL_CORRECTION_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE`.

The reviewed train is eligible only for aggregate draft decisions and QA closure. It is not eligible for public report publication, sitemap inclusion, public JSON, report registry inclusion, Public API/MCP exposure, data repo export, external distribution, deploy, or project-level claims.

## Reviewed Scope

Reviewed tasks:

| Task | Result | Reviewed artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR176 / REPORT_DATA0 | `GO_REPORT_DATA1_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE` | `docs/scout/REPORT_DATA0_REAL_REPORT_DATA_ELIGIBILITY_SCAN.md` |
| PR177 / REPORT_DATA1 | `GO_REPORT_DATA2_AGGREGATE_DRAFT_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE` | `docs/scout/REPORT_DATA1_AI_PROJECT_READINESS_DATA_BACKED_REPORT.md` |
| PR178 / REPORT_DATA2 | `GO_REPORT_DATAQ_QA_ONLY_NO_PUBLIC_SURFACE` | `docs/scout/REPORT_DATA2_CHINESE_OUTBOUND_AI_PROJECT_READINESS_REPORT.md` |

PR179 changes only QA/status metadata and does not add app, component, script, schema, migration, package, public, API, MCP, data repo, deploy, or server/cloud files.

## Dataset Eligibility QA

Current eligible evidence remains aggregate-only:

| Evidence | Count / status | QA verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR171 staging dry-run source rows | `40` | Eligible for input-universe context only. |
| PR171 staging dry-run sample rows | `5` | Eligible for payload-shape context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture source rows | `40` | Eligible for input-universe context only. |
| PR174 audit fixture rows | `20` | Eligible for fixture-size context only. |
| PR172 staging no-publish QA | `PASS` | Confirms no-public staging boundary. |
| PR175 audit worker runtime QA | `PASS` | Confirms no external HTTP audit/runtime boundary. |
| PR177 English aggregate draft | `validation passed` | Wording boundary is aggregate-only. |
| PR178 Chinese aggregate draft | `validation passed` | Wording boundary is internal-only. |
| External HTTP audit rows | `0` | No project-level audit outcome exists. |
| Public report dataset rows | `0` | No public dataset exists. |

QA verdict: pass for aggregate-only draft and QA closure. No project-level readiness result exists.

## TTL And Correction QA

PR177 and PR178 both require any future real-observation report to include:

- observation date;
- data source class;
- stale label when an observation ages out;
- correction request path;
- re-audit or re-review path;
- bounded wording for missing, blocked, timeout, unsupported, or stale sources;
- explicit separation between fixture rows and reviewed public observations.

QA verdict: pass. TTL and correction language is documented as a future publication requirement only. No live TTL system, public correction route, public report dataset, or public distribution path is created in this train.

## Aggregate-only Claims QA

Allowed claims verified:

- 88CN can describe private-by-default staging and audit governance boundaries.
- Current evidence can describe sample-size, fixture-mode, and no-runtime constraints.
- Current evidence can describe the absence of public report, sitemap, public JSON, Public API/MCP, data repo export, staging write, production write, and deploy.
- English and Chinese drafts are internal aggregate wording decisions.

Denied claims verified:

- no claim that any project passed or failed readiness;
- no project ranking, score, benchmark, recommendation, or comparison;
- no website availability, traffic, revenue, user, financing, backer-interest, founder-verification, or growth claim;
- no project-level audit result;
- no public dataset, public report page, sitemap entry, Public API/MCP exposure, data repo export, or external distribution.

QA verdict: pass. The train remains process-readiness only.

## No-public-surface QA

Verified no new work in:

- `app/**`;
- `components/**`;
- `lib/**`;
- `scripts/**`;
- `supabase/**`;
- `deploy/**`;
- `middleware.ts`;
- `package.json`;
- `package-lock.json`;

- `screenshots/**`;
- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data/**`;
- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-web/**`;
- `/Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-api/**`.

QA verdict: pass. No public page, sitemap, public JSON, Public API, MCP, data repo export, deploy, server/cloud mutation, Supabase write, staging write, production write, external HTTP audit, browser fallback, worker runtime, queue, Redis, social/email/DM/CRM action, or external distribution occurred.

## Train Closure
