# WORKER0 Scout Worker Boundary + Chain Readiness

Status: validation passed
Task: PR160 / WORKER0
Result: GO_WORKER1_WITH_PR160_PR179_CHAIN_REGISTERED
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR160 defines the `88cn-scout-worker` boundary and registers the PR160-PR179 implementation-readiness chain.

Result: `GO_WORKER1_WITH_PR160_PR179_CHAIN_REGISTERED`.

Meaning:

- the future worker/runtime boundary belongs outside the 88CN public web runtime boundary;
- worker code must not live in `app/**`, `components/**`, public routes, sitemap code, Public API, MCP, or other public runtime paths;
- `88cn-scout-worker` may become a future repo, package, or isolated workspace only behind a later human checkpoint;
- `PR161 / WORKER1` may proceed next as a checkpointed no-runtime bootstrap task only;
- `PR162 / WORKERQ` must QA isolation before Seed 100 work starts;
- PR163-PR179 are registered as the next split chain;
- six phase trains are registered after PR160, beginning with `TRAIN-PR161-PR162-WORKER-BOOTSTRAP-QA`.

No worker, repo, package, dependency, crawler, external HTTP audit, Supabase migration, Redis/queue, staging write, production write, deploy, server/cloud mutation, data repo mutation, FermatMind repo mutation, public report page, sitemap entry, Public API, or MCP surface is created by PR160.

## Scope

In scope:

- convert PR159 / ARCH0 Route A into a detailed worker-boundary decision;
- define the high-level micro-agent blueprint without implementation;
- define HTTP-first audit policy and future headless fallback checkpoint rules;
- define Seed 100 source policy and lifecycle states;
- register PR160-PR179 roadmap tasks and dependencies;
- register post-PR160 train batches if validation passes;
- update current task/train pointers.

Out of scope:

- new repo or package creation;
- dependency installation;
- worker, crawler, queue, audit, report, API, MCP, route, or public UI implementation;
- external HTTP audit;
- browser automation or session export;
- Supabase migration or write;
- staging or production DB write;
- Redis/queue creation;
- deploy, SSH, cloud/server mutation;
- `.env` edit, secret read, or secret print;
- mutation of `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`;
- mutation of FermatMind repos;
- Growth, BETA, I18N, OPS10A, or PR101 start.

Immediate source of truth: PR159 selected Route A with result `GO_WORKER0_REPO_SPLIT_READINESS`.

## Worker Boundary Decision

Decision: future worker runtime must be outside the public web runtime boundary.

Boundary rules:

- `88CN` remains the public web, policy, docs, admin review, and publication-gate control repo.
- Worker/runtime behavior must not be added to public web paths.
- Worker code may initially be represented as docs and contracts only.
- A future `88cn-scout-worker` physical repo, package, or isolated workspace requires a human checkpoint.
- PR161 can create or prepare a no-runtime skeleton only if that checkpoint explicitly permits the selected form.
- No worker process, queue consumer, crawler, external HTTP audit, staging write, production write, deploy, or public surface is authorized by PR160.

Server boundary:

- `HK-ALIYUN-01` remains public-web-only.
- FermatMind production hosts remain do-not-touch for 88CN workers.
- Tencent resources remain migration-source / sunsetting only.
- Shanghai Aliyun candidates remain conditional and require owner/capacity confirmation before any use.

## Micro-Agent Blueprint

This is an architecture blueprint only. No agent is implemented.

| Agent | Purpose | Allowed input/output | Forbidden by default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery Hint Agent | Find public identity hints. | `project_name`, `official_website_url`, `github_url`, `docs_url`, `source_url`, `source_type`, `discovered_at`. | Directory copy, third-party categories, third-party score/order fields, review text, private email, phone, private social handles, cookies, sessions. |
| Canonical Resolver Agent | Resolve identity conflicts. | Official domain, repo, docs, aliases, redirects, source fingerprints, conflict states. | Name-only matching, directory-only matching, merging forks/wrappers/templates without evidence. |
| HTTP-first Audit Agent | Audit official public project sources. | robots-aware lightweight HTTP observations, sitemap/head/canonical/JSON-LD/schema/GitHub/docs signals. | Headless browser, login, form submission, WAF bypass, proxy evasion, cookies, session export, bulk crawling. |
| Quarantine Classifier Agent | Classify failures and ambiguity. | Failure class, source URL, timestamp, retry eligibility, correction path. | Treating failures as permanent negative claims or public project-level judgments. |
| Report Aggregator Agent | Produce anonymous aggregate statistics. | `sample_count`, missing-rate metrics, link-rate metrics, quarantine breakdown, timestamp, method, TTL/correction path. | Project-level public shaming, unreviewed project-detail publication, global market sizing, superiority claims. |
| Growth Draft Agent | Draft distribution material from approved report data. | Local draft output under `/tmp/88cn-growth-drafts/` after report data approval. | Auto-send, auto-post, email send, DM send, GitHub issue creation, CRM write, platform login, external write. |

Canonical resolver must handle:

- one domain with many repos;
- one repo with many domains;
- same name across different projects;
- domain redirects;
- project rename;
- mirror sites;
- forks;
- wrappers;
- template repos.

## HTTP-First Audit Policy

Default audit policy: HTTP-first.

Allowed future HTTP-first observations, after an approved later task:

- robots-aware public URL fetches;
- `robots.txt`;
- `sitemap.xml`;
- HTML head metadata;
- canonical link;
- JSON-LD;
- SoftwareApplication schema;
- public GitHub/docs link presence;
- bounded timeout/retry/failure taxonomy.

Default limits carried forward:

- maximum 20 jobs per run;
- maximum concurrency 3;
- request timeout 8 seconds;
- maximum retries 3;
- failed scans must not zero out the last successful snapshot;
- source state can become stale instead of being erased.

Forbidden by default:

- headless browser;
- login;
- form submission;
- WAF bypass;
- proxy evasion;
- cookies;
- browser session export;
- bulk crawling;
- public-route-time recalculation.

## Headless Browser Fallback Policy

Headless browser is not allowed now.

Future fallback may be considered only through a separate checkpointed task such as `AUDIT_BROWSER0 / Headless Browser Fallback Boundary`.

Minimum checkpoint requirements:

- exact target class and reason HTTP-first is insufficient;
- no login, cookies, session export, or platform account use;
- no WAF bypass or proxy evasion;
- bounded concurrency and runtime;
- screenshots/artifacts stored outside public routes by default;
- no public project-level claim from unreviewed browser output;
- redaction and no-secret proof;
- no data repo mutation;
- no public page, sitemap, Public API, or MCP exposure.

## Seed 100 Source Policy

Future Seed 100 source mix:

| Source class | Target mix | Rule |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| GitHub / awesome lists / open-source AI projects | 40% | Prefer official repos and official docs. |
| Product launch sources / HN / public launch pages | 30% | Use as discovery hints; verify against official sources. |
| AI directories | 20% | Discovery hints only; no copied descriptions, categories, score/order fields, or recommendation copy. |
| Manually selected Chinese outbound AI projects | 10% | Require official source and original 88CN note before any public use. |

Rules:

- do not depend 100% on any directory;
- `source_url` is required for each hint;
- official source is preferred;
- rejected/quarantined hints must be tracked separately;
- Seed 100 must not go public;
- Seed 100 must not enter sitemap;
- Seed 100 must not enter `/landscape`, `/tasks`, alternatives, Public API, MCP, or reports as project-level data.

## Lifecycle State Machine

Primary lifecycle:

1. `discovered_hint`
2. `identity_candidate`
3. `canonical_candidate`
4. `audit_pending`
5. `audited_observation`
6. `review_candidate`
7. `published_candidate`
8. `published`

Failure and side states:

- `quarantined`
- `duplicate`
- `ambiguous_identity`
- `source_unavailable`
- `robots_blocked`
- `waf_blocked`
- `rejected_hint`

Public visibility rule:

Only `published` and explicitly reviewed aggregate outputs may be public. Everything before `published` is private/backstage and must not affect public routes, sitemap, Public API, MCP, `/landscape`, `/tasks`, alternatives, reports, or data repo exports.

## Exact Next Task/Train

Exact next task: `PR161 / WORKER1 - Worker Repo Skeleton / No-runtime Bootstrap v0`.

Exact next train: `TRAIN-PR161-PR162-WORKER-BOOTSTRAP-QA`.

PR161 must not start unless explicitly requested. It remains checkpointed and may only create or plan a no-runtime skeleton if the human checkpoint permits the selected repo/package/workspace boundary.

## Sidecar Findings

No new P0/P1/P2 sidecar finding is created by PR160.

Existing `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md` contains historical gate-maintenance and lifecycle-checker items. They do not block PR160 because this task is docs/status/roadmap/train metadata only and does not start implementation.
