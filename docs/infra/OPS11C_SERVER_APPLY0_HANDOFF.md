# OPS11C Server Apply0 Handoff

Result: GO_PR193_SCOUT_WORKER_REPO_BOOTSTRAP_WITH_SERVER_SIDECAR_PARTIAL
Date: 2026-06-21

## Source Evidence

OPS11C records the local OPS-SERVER-APPLY0 sidecar reports in `/private/tmp`:

- `/private/tmp/88cn-server-apply0-aliyun-architecture-prep.md`
- `/private/tmp/88cn-server-apply0-ssh-alias-summary.md`
- `/private/tmp/88cn-server-apply0-rollback-plan.md`

OPS-SERVER-APPLY0 result:

```text
OPS_SERVER_APPLY0_PARTIAL_PRIVATE_ONLY_HOSTS_PREPARED
```

## Handoff Status

| Field | Status |
| --- | --- |
| server_sidecar_status | PARTIAL_PRIVATE_ONLY_HOSTS_PREPARED |
| admin_host_prep | prepared_via_workbench |
| scout_host_prep | prepared_via_workbench |
| ops_host_prep | prepared_via_workbench |
| local_ssh_status | private_only_or_timeout |

| worker_status | not_started |
| queue_status | not_started |
| nginx_reload | not_performed |
| pm2_start | not_performed |
| deploy_status | not_performed |

## Host Interpretation

| Server class | Alias | OPS11C interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SH-ALIYUN-02 | `88cn-sh-admin` | Staging/admin prep is Workbench-only partially prepared. |
| SH-ALIYUN-03 | `88cn-sh-scout` | Scout/import/canonical prep is Workbench-only partially prepared. |
| SH-ALIYUN-04 | `88cn-sh-ops` | Ops/queue-monitoring/backup-spare prep is Workbench-only partially prepared. |

The Shanghai hosts remain private-only from the local workstation path. Future direct SSH still needs a separately approved bastion, VPN, EIP, or equivalent access path. Workbench-only prep does not mean runtime readiness.

## Registry Changes

OPS11C registers the handoff task in `ops/tasks/roadmap.json` as `OPS11C / SERVER_APPLY0_HANDOFF`.

OPS11C updates:

- `ops/tasks/current.json` to make `PR193 / SCOUT_WORKER_REPO_BOOTSTRAP` the next recommended task;
- `ops/trains/current.json` to move the active train to `TRAIN-WORKER-PIPELINE-20K` in `ready_for_pr193_no_runtime` state;
- `ops/trains/batches.json` to record that `PR193` may proceed only as no-runtime worker repo bootstrap;
- `docs/TASK_STATUS.md` and `docs/SIDECAR_ISSUES.md` to move the server-prep sidecar from hard blocked to Workbench-only partially prepared.

## PR193 Gate

OPS11C allows `PR193 / SCOUT_WORKER_REPO_BOOTSTRAP` to proceed only as a no-runtime worker repo bootstrap.

Allowed next work:

- create or verify the private `fermatmind/88cn-scout-worker` repository;
- add no-runtime documentation, contracts, fixtures, and README skeleton files;
- record the worker repo URL, branch, commit, or PR in the 88CN handoff doc;
- keep the worker repo positioned as a boundary and contract skeleton only.

Still blocked after OPS11C:

- PR194 and later worker/runtime tasks;
- staging write or production write;
- Supabase mutation or migration;
- Redis or queue creation;
- crawler or audit runtime;
- external HTTP audit;
- PM2 start;
- Nginx reload;
- deploy or live smoke;
- data repo mutation;
- FermatMind or Tencent mutation;
- secret or env read.

## Negative Confirmation

OPS11C did not:

- open Aliyun Workbench;
- use SSH;
- mutate cloud, server, Nginx, PM2, Redis, queue, runtime, audit, crawler, Supabase, staging, production, DNS, or security group state;
- touch FermatMind or Tencent resources;
- deploy or live-smoke production;
- read or print `.env`, tokens, private keys, DB URLs, or Redis URLs;
- mutate `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data`.

## Validation Evidence

Pre-edit main baseline:

- `npm run verify:day0` passed.
- `npm run policy:scan` passed.
- `npm run third-party:check` passed.
- `npm run agent:redact:check` passed.
- `npm run agent:batch:check` passed.
- `npm run agent:train-plan:check` passed.
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run agent:gate` passed.
- `node scripts/check-landscape-boundary.mjs` passed.
- `node scripts/check-task-discovery-boundary.mjs` passed.
- `node scripts/check-sector-density-boundary.mjs` passed.
- `node scripts/check-alternatives-canonical.mjs` is the repository's current alternatives checker entry.

An attempted direct `node scripts/check-alternatives-boundary.mjs` failed before edits because that file does not exist in this repository; this was a command-target mismatch, not an application validation failure.

## Final Decision

`PR188 / STAGING_ADMIN_HOST_PREP` and `PR189 / WORKER_AUDIT_HOST_PREP` are no longer recorded as hard blocked by missing host class evidence. They are recorded as Workbench-only partially prepared by OPS-SERVER-APPLY0.

`PR193 / SCOUT_WORKER_REPO_BOOTSTRAP` may proceed next as no-runtime worker repo bootstrap.

Stop after PR193. Do not start PR194 until separately approved.
