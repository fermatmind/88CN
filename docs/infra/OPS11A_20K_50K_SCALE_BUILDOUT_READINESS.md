# OPS11A 20k-50k Scale Buildout Train Split + Auto-Merge Readiness Scan

Status: validation passed
Task: OPS11A / OPS11A_20K_50K_SCALE_BUILDOUT_READINESS
Result: GO_SCALE_BUILDOUT_TRAINS_REGISTERED
Date: 2026-06-21

## Result

OPS11A converts the post-PR182A 88CN plan from a 50-project MVP path into a 20,000-50,000 project operating-system buildout plan.

Decision: `GO_SCALE_BUILDOUT_TRAINS_REGISTERED`.

The next executable task is `PR184 / PROJECT_CONTRACT_STAGING_SCHEMA_APPLY`, the numeric train-compatible remap of `PR182B`. It remains human-checkpointed because it involves Supabase staging schema apply. `PR186 / SERVER_CAPACITY_READINESS` may run in parallel as a read-only/docs-only server readiness path.

OPS11A is registration and readiness only. It does not start PR184, PR186, or any implementation task.

## Scope

In scope:

- review current state after PR181, PR182, and PR182A;
- document 20k-50k scale assumptions;
- resolve suffixed PR ID train compatibility;
- register numeric execution IDs for the buildout;
- classify future auto-merge eligibility and human checkpoints;
- register train segmentation and stop behavior;
- update task, train, and status metadata.

Out of scope:

- Supabase migration apply or connection;
- staging, production, or database writes;
- seed import;
- worker, crawler, audit, queue, Redis, or external HTTP runtime;
- Aliyun or Tencent console action;
- SSH, server prep, Nginx, PM2, Supervisor, systemd, cron, DNS, or security group changes;
- frontend implementation, sitemap runtime changes, Public API, or MCP release;
- data repo mutation;
- private seed row, raw evidence, canonical candidate, secret, or cloud/server identifier commits.

No private seed rows were read. No `.env` files were read. No secrets were printed.

## Current State After PR182A

Confirmed state:

- PR181 is merged and records 50 accepted private seed rows, 25 needs-review rows, 12 rejected rows, 20 GitHub-backed candidates, 5 strictly open-source declared candidates, 15 mixed candidates, and 30 commercial candidates.
- PR182 is merged and defines Entity -> Repo -> Web, Source Evidence, lifecycle states, `published_projection`, fail-closed sitemap/API/MCP gates, and field visibility.
- PR182A is merged and selects `READY_FOR_PR182B_WITH_HUMAN_CHECKPOINT`.
- PR182A confirms existing migrations `001`-`012`, RLS conventions, `public.projects`, and admin-only review/import tables, but no dedicated PR182 project contract staging table family.
- `main == origin/main` before OPS11A branch creation.
- 88CN worktree and `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` were clean before OPS11A edits.
- No PR182B/PR182C/OPS-SERVER/PR183A/PR184/PR185/PR186/PR187/PR188 implementation had started.

## 20k-50k Scale Assumptions

At 20,000-50,000 projects, 88CN needs an operating data plane, not a single small seed handoff.

Required assumptions:

- import must be sharded into batches with manifest, checksum, retry, quarantine, and review states;
- staging records must be separate from public projection records;
- admin review must support bulk triage, filters, state logs, and conflict resolution;
- workers must run outside public web request paths;
- audit jobs must be HTTP-first, rate-limited, retry-aware, and private by default;
- failed scans must preserve the last successful snapshot and mark stale instead of zeroing out scores;
- search and sitemap must be segmented and finite;
- frontend pages must read only reviewed projections;
- server roles must isolate public web, staging/admin, worker, audit, queue, logs, and backup paths.

## What Changes From The 50-Project MVP Plan

Invalid 50-project assumptions:

- one local artifact or one manual import pass is enough;
- a minimal control panel can be the immediate next implementation after PR182A;
- a single list page can scale without search, pagination, and finite collection rules;
- public sitemap can be one flat surface without segmentation;
- audit can be fixture-only or ad hoc;
- server placement can wait until after worker implementation;
- rejected, stale, and ambiguous states can stay as side notes rather than durable review states.

Still valid outputs:

- PR181 private seed integrity model and manual review blockers;
- PR182 Entity -> Repo -> Web contract and `published_projection` boundary;
- PR182 fail-closed sitemap/API/MCP policy;
- PR182A staging schema draft, RLS stance, rollback expectations, and no-seed-import default;
- OPS-INFRA shared-server isolation principle: shared hardware is allowed, shared risk is not.

Mandatory before 10,000 projects:

- project contract staging schema;
- bulk import contract;
- batch/import/quarantine job model;
- admin bulk review panel;
- worker bootstrap and isolated queue policy;
- HTTP-first audit worker with failure taxonomy;
- retry and dead-letter handling;
- published-only frontend listing/search/detail/collection pages;
- search index and sitemap segmentation;
- server capacity/readiness and host isolation plan.

## Task ID Compatibility And Remap Decision

Current train validators accept `PR<number>` IDs and selected non-PR families. They do not accept suffixed PR IDs such as `PR182B`, `PR183A`, or `PR184Q` inside train batches.

Decision:

- keep existing `PR182B` as a previously registered standalone checkpoint artifact;
- do not reference suffixed IDs in new train batches;
- remap the 20k-50k execution chain to numeric IDs `PR184` through `PR207`;
- preserve original intent through aliases.

Collision scan:

- existing numeric PR max before OPS11A: `PR183`;
- proposed numeric range: `PR184`-`PR207`;
- collision result: no numeric collision.

All registered train task IDs are runner-compatible numeric PR IDs.

## Database / Supabase Staging Plan

PR184 is the first data-plane implementation task and is the numeric remap of PR182B.

Rules:

- staging schema apply only;
- explicit human approval required;
- no production write;
- no seed import in PR184;
- RLS fail-closed by default;
- rollback and post-apply schema smoke required.

20k-50k planning additionally needs later contracts for:

- `import_batches`;
- `worker_jobs`;
- `audit_runs`;
- `quarantine_events`;
- `report_snapshots`;
- search index candidates;
- sitemap candidates.

Those are not created by OPS11A.

## Server Readiness / OPS Plan

Server path:

- PR186: read-only/docs-only capacity readiness scan;
- PR187: isolation plan and runbook;
- PR188: staging/admin host prep, checkpointed;
- PR189: worker/audit host prep, checkpointed.

OPS11A performs no fresh Aliyun/Tencent scan except reading existing redacted OPS-INFRA reports. No server action occurs.

Carry-forward rules:

- `HK-ALIYUN-01` remains public-web-only;
- FermatMind production hosts remain do-not-touch for 88CN workers;
- Tencent resources are migration-source/sunsetting only;
- Shanghai Aliyun candidates require owner/capacity confirmation before use.

## Control Panel Plan

20k-50k requires more than the previous minimal control panel:

- bulk staging record triage;
- review filters for missing docs, identity conflict, reachability, source class, stale, rejected, and quarantine;
- manual lifecycle state switching;
- immutable review log;
- no auto-publish;
- no unreviewed public projection.

PR190 and PR191 are checkpointed implementation tasks. PR192 is QA-only and may be auto-merge eligible if executed alone.

## Worker / Queue / Audit Plan

Worker path:

- PR193: worker boundary/bootstrap;
- PR194: bulk import worker;
- PR195: canonical resolver worker;
- PR196: HTTP-first audit worker;
- PR197: retry/dead-letter queue;
- PR198: worker QA.

Required scale rules:

- no public-route-time crawl or score recalculation;
- default batch cap and concurrency controls;
- request timeout and retry limits;
- failed scans mark stale and preserve last successful snapshot;
- browser fallback requires separate checkpoint;
- no WAF bypass, login, cookie use, proxy evasion, or platform session export.

## Frontend / Sitemap Segmentation Plan

20k-50k frontend must include:

- listing pagination;
- search;
- filters;
- finite reviewed collections;
- published-only project detail pages;
- sitemap segmentation;
- no broad faceted pSEO;
- no raw seed, source evidence, audit, review note, rejected, or quarantine exposure.

PR199-PR202 are checkpointed public-surface tasks. PR203 is QA-only.

## Report / Growth Plan

PR206 requires real reviewed audit/report data. Fixture-only and aggregate-only draft evidence is insufficient for a public report.

PR207 may use only approved report-backed material. By default it must not send email, DM, social posts, CRM writes, or any external write.

## Sidecar Findings

Findings:

- Existing `PR182B` remains registered as a standalone suffixed checkpoint from PR182A, but new trains use `PR184` as the numeric remap.
- Existing `PR183 / CONTROL_PANEL` remains in roadmap as the earlier minimal control panel task, but the 20k-50k path supersedes it with `PR190`-`PR192`.
- `TRAIN-SERVER-READINESS` is auto-merge eligible; server prep is not.
- `TRAIN-DATA-PLANE` starts with a human-checkpointed Supabase apply and must not auto-run through PR184.

No sidecar-blocking issue was found.

## Exact Next Task / Train

Exact next task:

`PR184 / PROJECT_CONTRACT_STAGING_SCHEMA_APPLY`

Exact next train:

`TRAIN-DATA-PLANE`

Parallel read-only task:

`PR186 / SERVER_CAPACITY_READINESS`

Do not start either task inside OPS11A.
