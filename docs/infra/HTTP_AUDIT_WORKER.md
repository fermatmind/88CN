## Implemented Capabilities

Worker PR #3 adds fixture-only HTTP-first audit support:

- URL input contract;
- audit result contract;
- HTTP-first policy defaults;
- global concurrency cap;
- per-domain cooldown contract;
- timeout / retry / backoff policy fields;
- failure taxonomy;
- fixture response evaluator;
- last successful snapshot preservation;
- stale marking;
- reachable / canonical / sitemap / JSON-LD / SoftwareApplication / GitHub / docs output fields;
- audit observation hash;
- fixture and no-dependency Node test.

## Boundary

- live network by default;
- `fetch`, `http.request`, or `https.request` execution;
- Playwright, headless browser, or browser fallback;
- WAF bypass;
- proxy evasion;
- login, cookies, or session use;
- unbounded crawl;
- server runtime;
- database writes;
- Supabase connection;
- staging or production writes;
- Redis or queue runtime;
- package metadata or dependencies;
- deploy;
- private seed artifacts;
- secrets or env reads.
