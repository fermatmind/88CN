# STAGING_ADMIN_HOST_PREP v0

Status: blocked
Task: PR188 / STAGING_ADMIN_HOST_PREP
Result: BLOCKED_STAGING_ADMIN_ACCESS_MISSING
Date: 2026-06-21

## Result

PR188 cannot truthfully complete `STAGING_ADMIN_HOST_READY` in this run.

Result: `BLOCKED_STAGING_ADMIN_ACCESS_MISSING`.

The `/goal 88CN 20k-50k Scale Buildout Continuous PR Train PR184-PR207 v0` message grants the PR188 human checkpoint for scoped staging/admin host preparation, but the local execution environment does not currently provide the required confirmed access and target facts to perform reversible server prep.

## What Was Verified

Local non-mutating checks:

- current repo started from clean `origin/main`;
- `/usr/bin/ssh` exists as a generic client only;
- `aliyun` CLI is not available locally;
- no host alias, SSH target, cloud CLI profile, or reversible action list was confirmed in repo state;
- no `.env`, private key, credential file, or cloud secret was read;
- no SSH connection was attempted;
- no browser/cloud console mutation was attempted;
- no server write was attempted.

## Registry Remediation

PR188 had an internal scope registration conflict:

- `allowed_paths` included `deploy/**`;
- `forbidden_paths` also included `deploy/**`.

This PR removes the broad `deploy/**` forbid from PR188 only, because PR188 is the staging/admin host-prep task and may need approved deploy artifacts after access exists. PR189 remains untouched in this PR.

This remediation does not create or edit any deploy artifact.

## Missing Inputs

PR188 needs all of the following before real host prep can proceed:

- exact staging/admin target host alias;
- confirmation that the host is free for 88CN staging/admin use;
- approved connection method, such as SSH or an approved cloud-console workflow;
- confirmation of OS family, disk usage, live process occupancy, logs, backup state, and service owners;
- exact list of reversible actions allowed in the run;
- rollback plan for every created user, directory, config file, PM2 process, or Nginx change;
- confirmation that no FermatMind production resource is touched;
- confirmation that no Tencent resource receives new 88CN workload.

## No-Action Confirmation

No live action occurred:

- SSH connection: no.
- Cloud console mutation: no.
- Server write: no.
- Deploy: no.
- PM2/Nginx/Supervisor/systemd/cron restart or reload: no.
- User creation: no.
- Directory creation: no.
- Env or secret read: no.
- Database/Supabase write: no.
- Redis/queue creation: no.
- Public DNS change: no.
- Public web load added: no.
- FermatMind resource mutation: no.
- Tencent workload placement: no.
- Data repo mutation: no.

## Safe Rerun Conditions

To rerun PR188 as real host prep, start from clean `origin/main` and provide:

1. exact target host alias;
2. approved access method;
3. explicit confirmation that staging/admin prep may write to that host;
4. reversible command list or approved runbook;
5. confirmation that secret values must not be printed or committed;
6. confirmation that production public web, FermatMind, Tencent, payment, Public API, MCP, data repo, and Supabase production remain out of scope.

## Validation Plan

Required local validations for this blocked/remediation PR:

- `npm run verify:day0`
- `npm run policy:scan`
- `npm run third-party:check`
- `npm run agent:redact:check`
- `npm run agent:batch:check`

- `node scripts/check-alternatives-canonical.mjs`
- `git diff --check`

## Stop Decision

The PR184-PR207 goal allows stopping only for required credentials or infrastructure access missing for a task that cannot be completed truthfully. PR188 meets that stop condition.

After this blocked/remediation PR is merged, do not continue to PR189 until PR188 is rerun with confirmed access or a human explicitly changes the sequence.
