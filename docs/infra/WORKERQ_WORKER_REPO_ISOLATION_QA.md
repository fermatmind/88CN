# WORKERQ Worker Repo Isolation QA

Status: validation passed
Task: PR162 / WORKERQ
Result: PASS_WORKER_REPO_ISOLATION_QA
Date: 2026-06-20

## Result

PR162 verifies the worker boundary and no-runtime bootstrap work from PR160 and PR161.

Result: `PASS_WORKER_REPO_ISOLATION_QA`.

The reviewed worker bootstrap train remains docs/contracts-only. No worker repository, package, workspace, runtime source, crawler, external HTTP audit, Supabase migration/write, staging write, production write, Redis/queue, deploy, server/cloud mutation, data repo mutation, FermatMind repo mutation, public route, sitemap entry, Public API, MCP, report publication surface, or Seed 100 work was introduced.

## Scope

In scope:

- verify PR160 / WORKER0 and PR161 / WORKER1 merge state;
- review changed files from the worker bootstrap train;
- verify public web isolation;
- verify no package/runtime/dependency changes;
- verify no data repo mutation;
- verify PR163 / SCOUT_SEED0 handoff can proceed only after WORKERQ closes.

Out of scope:

- product/runtime/generator edits;
- worker implementation;
- creating a worker repo/package/workspace;
- dependency changes;
- crawler or external HTTP audit;
- Supabase/staging/production writes;
- Redis/queue creation;
- deploy, SSH, cloud/server mutation;
- public report publication, sitemap inclusion, Public API, or MCP release;
- Seed 100 execution;
- data repo mutation;
- FermatMind repo mutation.

## Merge Verification

| PR | Task | State | Merge commit | Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #199 | PR160 / WORKER0 | MERGED | `24cfc2630acf4f499518b360ab161b94e9216779` | Boundary and chain registration only. |
| #200 | PR161 / WORKER1 | MERGED | `01f133ef19aae29196760b18cb4dbd556553f4a5` | No-runtime bootstrap specification only. |

Local `main` was synced to `origin/main` after PR161 before PR162 work began.

## Isolation Checklist

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker did not enter public web runtime | PASS | No `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, middleware, public asset, API, or route files changed. |
| No app route | PASS | Changed files are docs/ops only. |
| No API/MCP route | PASS | No API/MCP path changed; Public API/MCP checks pass. |
| No sitemap change | PASS | No sitemap runtime or public route files changed; landscape and task/alternatives checks pass. |
| No worker runtime | PASS | PR161 explicitly created a docs-only skeleton specification, not source files. |
| No crawler | PASS | No scripts/runtime files changed and no crawler was run in PR160-PR162. |
| No external HTTP audit | PASS | PR160/PR161 are docs-only and PR162 is QA-only. |
| No Supabase/staging/production write | PASS | No migration/runtime/storage path changed. |
| No Redis/queue | PASS | No queue/runtime/server config changed. |
| No new dependency | PASS | `package.json` and `package-lock.json` unchanged. |
| No data repo mutation | PASS | `/Users/rainie/Desktop/88cn-index-data` is clean on `main...origin/main`. |

| No public surface changes | PASS | No public route, sitemap, report registry, Public API, or MCP release was introduced. |
| Seed 100 not started | PASS | PR163 remains the exact next task after WORKERQ. |

## Package And Runtime Probe

Repository search for worker-related top-level artifacts found only existing documentation plus existing package files:

```text
docs/infra/ARCH0_WORKER_ARCHITECTURE_REPO_SPLIT_READINESS.md
docs/infra/OPS_INFRA2X_88CN_STAGING_WORKER_PLACEMENT_DECISION.md
docs/infra/WORKER0_SCOUT_WORKER_BOUNDARY_CHAIN_READINESS.md
docs/infra/WORKER1_WORKER_REPO_SKELETON_NO_RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP.md
docs/scout/AUDIT_IMPL0_WORKER_QUEUE_CAPACITY_BOUNDARY.md
docs/scout/AUDIT_IMPLQ_WORKER_QA.md
package-lock.json
package.json
```

No worker package directory or worker runtime source was created.

## Train Closure

`TRAIN-PR161-PR162-WORKER-BOOTSTRAP-QA` is complete after PR162.

Next train:

`TRAIN-PR163-PR165-SCOUT-SEED-MVP`

Exact next task:

`PR163 / SCOUT_SEED0 - Seed 100 Source Mix + Discovery Hint Policy v0`

PR163 must use Seed50R files, if present, only as research input. It must not ingest them directly, mutate the data repo, expose public records, trigger audit, or start PR164.

## Sidecar Findings

No new P0/P1/P2 sidecar finding is created by PR162.

No stale checker issue blocks WORKERQ. The required local checks and current PR scope validation pass.
