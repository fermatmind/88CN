## Data Repo NPM Scripts

| Script | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `validate` | `node scripts/validate-projects.mjs` |
| `aggregate` | `node scripts/aggregate-projects.mjs` |
| `privacy:check` | `node scripts/check-forbidden-fields.mjs` |
| `taxonomy:check` | `node scripts/check-taxonomy.mjs` |
| `seed:check` | `node scripts/check-seed-batch.mjs` |
| `test` | taxonomy, privacy, validate, aggregate, seed checks |

## Recommended `agent:gate` Scripts

Recommended main repo gate:

1. `npm run verify:day0`
2. `npm run db:schema:check`
3. `npm run public-surface:check`
4. `npm run intake:check`
5. `npm run external-import:check`
6. `npm run geo-checker:check`
7. `npm run lint`
8. `npm run typecheck`
9. `npm run build`

Recommended data repo gate:

1. `npm run taxonomy:check`
2. `npm run privacy:check`
3. `npm run validate`
4. `npm run aggregate`
5. `npm run seed:check`
6. `npm test`

Current caveat: main repo gate is not fully green until the README public-copy blocker is resolved.

## Roadmap Tasks To Register

| Task | Proposed focus |
| --- | --- |
| PR31 | Seed 100 staged import QA with quarantine finding |
| PR32 | Consumer-side quarantine summary and import-safety fix |
| PR33 | Agent gate script and OPS runbook |
| PR34 | Boundary contracts and redaction policy enforcement |

## Contracts For OPS-1

OPS-1 should create explicit contracts for:

- telemetry
- cache-tags
- event-outbox
- redaction
- featured-signals-boundary
- public-api-boundary
- mcp-boundary
- payment-boundary

## Redaction Policy Recommendation

- Default to hard fail on secret-like material.
- `--fix` may be allowed only for low-risk generated artifacts.
- Real secrets must never be automatically rewritten by an agent.
- Reports should use `REDACTED` for server addresses, env values, private keys, session material, and credential-bearing URLs.
- GitHub auth state must not be printed into reports.

## Build And QA Triage Policy Recommendation

1. Separate gate failures from build failures.
2. Treat policy scanner failures as release blockers even if build passes.
3. Continue static scanning after a gate failure and mark the result PARTIAL unless the repo cannot be inspected.
4. Keep implementation fixes out of Codex-QA tasks; QA may only write scoped reports.
5. When a data generator mutates output during QA, restore or verify clean worktree before leaving the repo.
6. Do not promote imported data from staging to public state without an explicit admin review task.
